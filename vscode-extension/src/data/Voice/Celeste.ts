    1: "Okay, but what about that other empty seat?",
    2: "There were only fifteen of us to begin with, so why are there sixteen seats?",
    3: "She must have been attacked in the main room first. Then, she ran to the bathroom to try and hide.",
    4: "The killer followed her in, and that's where they finished the job.",
    5: "Hina seems the obvious candidate. After all, she just said she was in the dining hall.",
    6: "But if it wasn't either of you, then what other possibility is there?",
    7: "The reason all the hair was gone was to remove any trace that Sayaka had ever been there.",
    8: "That makes sense, does it not?",
    9: "What do you mean?",
    10: "Okay, but then why would the killer even think the door was locked in the first place?",
    11: "Everyone should have known you can't lock any of the boys' bathrooms.",
    12: "Does no one have any other thoughts or questions? It does not matter how trivial they may seem.",
    13: "Oh. You.",
    14: "But can we be sure anyone even got this note?",
    15: "And honestly, even if they did, I do not think they are at all involved in what happened.",
    16: "Would you like to hear what I have to say?",
    17: "Very well, then. Pay attention.",
    18: "Sayaka and Makoto switched rooms, correct?",
    19: "but in the note, the place they were asked to come to,",
    20: "It specifically says my room.",
    21: "Exactly. The room that Makoto was staying in.",
    22: "So in other words, even if someone did read the note and did what it said,",
    23: "They would not have any connection to what happened.",
    24: "They got... switched?",
    25: "Sayaka fought with her killer there in the room, yes?",
    26: "Perhaps the answer to our previous question lies in that initial struggle.",
    27: "Which brings up another point. Makoto, Sayaka was the one who suggested you two switch rooms, correct?",
    28: "maybe the reason she wanted to switch rooms.",
    29: "was so that she could pin the crime on you. That is a possibility, is it not?",
    30: "That would also explain why she would switch the nameplates.",
    31: "She wanted to get whoever she had targeted to come to Makoto's room, where she was staying.",
    32: "And by committing the murder there, instead of her room, that would implicate Makoto.",
    33: "But for that to work, the target had to be lured out while still keeping the room swap a secret.",
    34: "If the target knew she had switched rooms, they would have become suspicious right away.",
    35: "But in the end, her plan backfired.",
    36: "She launched her attack with the knife, then found herself under attack in turn.",
    37: "That must be when her wrist got broken, and she was forced to drop the knife.",
    38: "Do we really have time for all that?",
    39: "Well, before we get too far into that, I need to ask.",
    40: "Can we really be sure that Sayaka is the one who wrote it?",
    41: "But one piece burned off and got left behind.",
    42: "A target 30 feet away would surely be little challenge for the ultimate baseball star.",
    43: "Then it would seem we are finished here."

    metadata: { index: 4813 },
    1: "You're saying Genocide Jack is one of us?",
    2: "But I cannot imagine anyone other than you could murder someone in such a bizarre fashion.",
    3: "Perhaps if you had an alibi, that would change things.",
    4: "What is your point?",
    5: "That does make some amount of sense.",
    6: "Then, the reason he pushed the theory of Genocide Jack being the killer so hard was",
    7: "Because he wanted to pin the crime on her.",
    8: "but Chihiro was suspended with",
    9: "It was some kind of robe, was it not?",
    10: "So you're saying that maybe the posters were switched?",
    11: "Then, does that mean that the carpets were switched too?",
    12: "But why would anyone do that?",
    13: "I can certainly follow your reasoning, but why would the culprit bother doing that?",
    14: "Why would they go to all that trouble of switching the scene of the crime?",
    15: "Actually, an even bigger question. If the murder did take place in the boys' locker room,",
    16: "Then how did Chihiro get in the boys' locker room in the first place?",
    17: "To get into the locker rooms, you have to swipe your e-handbook across the card reader device.",
    18: "But Chihiro's handbook should have only allowed her access to the girls' locker room.",
    19: "She had no way to get into the boys' locker room to begin with.",
    20: "I highly doubt that.",
    21: "Is it really possible?",
    22: "Could Chihiro really have gotten into the boys' locker room somehow?",
    23: "Plus, isn't there a regulation against using someone else's handbook?",
    24: "And you think that might be because it doesn't have anything to do with him?",
    25: "That's true. Very well then. I'm with you too.",
    26: "Thank you.",
    27: "Now that you mention it, yes. I did see him.",
    28: "Oh, but I suppose only Makoto knows about this.",
    29: "The rest of you had no idea, did you? That is why you're all making such ugly noises.",
    30: "It was last night, right before night time. I saw Chihiro in the dormitory warehouse.",
    31: "I saw him stuffing a track jacket into a duffel bag.",
    32: "And then, I assume, he headed off to exercise.",
    33: "And that is when he said something that struck me as rather odd.",
    34: "Chihiro told me he was in a hurry.",
    35: "But why would he be in a hurry? Only if someone were waiting for him, I should think.",
    36: "Which means that conversely, he must have trusted whoever he was meeting with very much.",
    37: "Enough so that he was willing to risk his secret being revealed.",
    38: "Are you sure about that?",
    39: "You really think we can figure out who did it based on two pieces of evidence that we don't have?",
    40: "The bag was just a normal duffel bag from the warehouse.",
    41: "All the bags in there are the same, so I can't imagine what would make that one special.",
    42: "Did any of that really help us get any closer to figuring out who the culprit is?",
    43: "As a matter of fact, it was... blue?",
    44: "The only one I told about any of this was you.",
    45: "Ah, now I understand. It was all one big bluff, wasn't it?",
    46: "Your true intention was to draw a slip of the tongue from the culprit.",
    47: "That's why you said you knew who did it. To put them on edge.",
    48: "Well, this does present us with a problem. It seems we are all out of leads.",
    49: "I imagine the culprit broke it to get rid of any evidence after the murder.",
    50: "And yet, this one does appear to be broken, as is Leon's, sitting useless in the main hall.",
    51: "For all your confidence, that is a remarkably high failure rate.",
    52: "In other words, if Mundo's handbook is actually broken,",
    53: "then that proves that what Makoto said is right.",
    54: "So then, the broken handbook in the main hall is actually Mondo's.",
    55: "Which would mean that the handbook Mondo has right now is actually Leon's, yes?"

  [Chapter.Chapter_3]: {
    metadata: { index: 4868 },
    1: "It was Hiro. He does not have an alibi for when the murders took place, and we found him in that suit.",
    2: "I am sorry to say, Hiro, but we do have evidence.",
    3: "Blueprints for the suit.",
    4: "Parts we assume were used to build it?",
    5: "And all of it was found in your room. You have to admit, the evidence is quite compelling.",
    6: "It points to you as having created the suit and wearing it while committing crime after crime.",
    7: "Everything we found in your room.",
    8: "The blueprints, the suit parts, they are all proof enough.",
    9: "that you are the culprit.",
    10: "What do you mean?",
    11: "Unless that person made it a point to disguise their handwriting.",
    12: "And what reason do you have to make such a statement? You do have a reason, yes?",
    13: "In other words, you think they use the dolly to move the body, am I right?",
    14: "But are you sure you are not mistaken?",
    15: "Are you absolutely positive the dolly was in the equipment room when we found Taka's body?",
    16: "That dolly was made specifically for moving large objects between the repository and the art room.",
    17: "It would be very strange indeed to discover it had made its way to the equipment room.",
    18: "Is it not possible that it was in the repository all along, and you simply didn't realize it?",
    19: "There is no shame in being wrong. Nobody expects much from you anyway.",
    20: "We have all accepted the fact that you rarely understand what is going on around you.",
    21: "Eh?",
    22: "Well, what's to stop you from simply pushing the dolly with your feet?",
    23: "No, wait. Just a second, if you please. Have you forgotten about the picture that I took?",
    24: "You all got a good look at it, did you not? The image of Hifumi being dragged away by Robo-Justice?",
    25: "If whoever was in that suit is not the culprit, how do you explain that?",
    26: "Besides, do you remember what the now deceased Hifumi said?",
    27: "So long as those facts exist, the proper conclusion is beyond question.",
    28: "The individual inside the suit and the culprit are one and the same. It was Hiro, without a doubt.",
    29: "It seems I was unconscious for about an hour after I was attacked by my mystery assailant.",
    30: "I know it was an hour because I remember being attacked a little after seven.",
    31: "I saw someone moving around on the third floor, and I yelled out to everyone as soon as I did.",
    32: "And it does not stop there. There was also the moment when we discovered his body had disappeared.",
    33: "When his body vanished from the nurse's office,",
    34: "Hina and I were in the bathroom together, while everyone else was in the equipment room, correct?",
    35: "And then there's the disappearance of Taka's body from the equipment room.",
    36: "At that time, we were all gathered together in the nurse's office because of Hifumi going missing.",
    37: "In other words, it is impossible that any of us could have killed Hifumi or moved either of their bodies.",
    38: "On the other hand, Hiro and Kyoko had disappeared, so they most certainly could have done those things.",
    39: "That it isn't possible.",
    40: "No. It is impossible.",
    41: "Hifumi was dead, without a doubt.",
    42: "Surely you heard the body discovery announcement along with the rest of us.",
    43: "Hifumi's dead body had been found.",
    44: "And that is why the announcement was made.",
    45: "Of course it was. The announcement played right after we discovered his body.",
    46: "Maybe Monokuma simply got lazy and rolled them together into one.",
    47: "That is the worst logic I have ever heard.",
    48: "But honestly, I do not think there's anything that can prove he was still alive.",
    49: "This whole thing is pointless.",
    50: "But when you compare his body before being moved and his body after being moved,",
    51: "Other than the change in how it was positioned,",
    52: "There was no notable difference.",
    53: "Of course not. It is impossible. This is ridiculous.",
    54: "Perhaps you'd like to fill the rest of us in?",
    55: "Even if that is true, it does not mean he wiped the blood off himself.",
    56: "And what might that be?",
    57: "So the question is, how could the culprit have gotten their hands on either of the hammers?",
    58: "Personally, I haven't a clue.",
    59: "Well, whatever it was,",
    60: "There's one thing we have to figure out.",
    61: "How was the culprit able to move around so freely with the weapon?",
    62: "How did nobody witness them carrying it?",
    63: "Hold on a moment. I still think it's strange to assume someone was working together with him.",
    64: "The way the graduation rule works, there is no benefit to helping someone else carry out a murder.",
    65: "So the idea that anyone would work together like that is simply ludicrous. We talked about this, did we not?",
    66: "Based on the rules that have been laid out for us,",
    67: "Even if more than one person is complicit in the murder,",
    68: "Only the one who actually carried out the act can graduate and survive.",
    69: "Assuming the rule holds true, it is simply impossible that two people work together on this.",
    70: "Ah, so I'm the suspicious individual now, am I?",
    71: "I really do hate this kind of joke.",
    72: "So what you are saying, then, is that I specifically chose to work together with Hifumi.",
    73: "The idea that I would choose to spend any amount of time interacting with him...",
    74: "That I would go within ten feet of that shit for brains, that lazy, worthless, goddamn idiot!",
    75: "Ah, pardonnez-moi.",
    76: "Is that so?",
    77: "I have no idea what you mean.",
    78: "Oh, did I?",
    79: "What are you talking about?",
    80: "All I said was,",
    81: "They must really be enjoying this.",
    82: "Enjoying the sight of us standing around, frightened and confused.",
    83: "They must be positively elated.",
    84: "We are all going to die here.",
    85: "We are going to die. Just like those guys died.",
    86: "And that is all I said.",
    87: "*laughs*",
    88: "You all have such vivid imaginations, you know that?",
    89: "You claim that I was lying when I told you about the suspicious person I saw.",
    90: "Then what about the picture I took?",
    91: "How do you explain this picture of the costumed villain dragging Hifumi away?",
    92: "Have you so quickly forgotten? You are the only one who could have possibly fit into that suit.",
    93: "Plus, I happen to know that this particular camera does not have a timer.",
    94: "In other words, it is an unassailable fact that this is a picture of Hifumi being dragged away.",
    95: "If everything I told you was a lie, how can this picture exist?",
    96: "What could you possibly mean by that?",
    97: "No. There is no other explanation.",
    98: "Eh?",
    99: "\"Hmph! Hahahaha!\"",
    100: "Such a thing.",
    101: "is utterly impossible.",
    102: "Hifumi was dragging him away? Ridiculous.",
    103: "Then shut your mouth and allow me to educate you.",
    104: "Like I said, ridiculous.",
    105: "As you can see in the picture, the suspect is standing perfectly upright.",
    106: "If the person inside the suit was unconscious,",
    107: "There's no way they could stand up straight like that.",
    108: "*Sigh*",
    109: "No, no, no, no!",
    110: "Checkmate?",
    111: "Heh, heh heh heh, heh!",
    112: "hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe",
    113: "Don't make me laugh, you idiot. What do you mean, checkmate?",
    114: "Clearly, you want to cram me into your little guilty box. Well, there's one little problem.",
    115: "Have you already forgotten what Hifumi told us as he lay dying?",
    116: "When we asked him who had attacked him, his answer was quite clear, was it not?",
    117: "He said, and I quote, Yasuhiro!",
    118: "In other words, Yasuhiro Hagakure!",
    119: "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'LL BURN YOU ALIVE!",
    120: "I'm sure it was just... incidental. By chance, he just... his... first name...",
    121: "Wh-wh-what did you just say?",
    122: "To think you'd take your false accusation so far. I don't know whether to laugh or spit.",
    123: "Come on! Enough with your idiotic blather! Yasuhiro is a loser's name! Do I look like a loser to you?",
    124: "Well? Do I?",
    125: "WHAT?! I think I've earned the right to be a little on edge.",
    126: "Fine! Make sure your ear holes are wide open and listen up!",
    127: "My real name is Celestia Ludenberg. Could you please stop making me repeat myself over and over again?",
    128: "How many times do I have to tell you?",
    129: "My name is...",
    130: "CELESCIA LUTENBURG, GODDAMMIT!",
    131: "I'm not pretending. It's the truth.",
    132: "And since you have no way to contradict me,",
    133: "That's the only truth there is! Moron!",
    134: "WHAT?!",
    135: "Th-that's an invasion of privacy! I-I refuse to cooperate!",
    136: "Even when I'm put in check, it's just my nature not to give up.",
    137: "Because...",
    138: "Because... because... because, because, because, BECAUSE, BECAUSE!",
    139: "Until the game's over, you never know what might happen!",
    140: "I...lost?",
    141: "I lost?",
    142: "When was the last time I was forced to utter such words?",
    143: "They hang heavy around my neck.",
    144: "Hmph! Listen to you, trying to take charge, as if you're my private instructor!",
    145: "I, Celestia Ludenberg... Actually, no.",
    146: "Taeko, Yasuhiro is fine.",
    147: "I'm the kind of person, once I've lost, I don't like things to drag on.",
    148: "Okay, Monokuma. I'm ready to begin.",
    149: "Or, no.",
    150: "I suppose this is the end, isn't it?",
