    1: "Okay, then. Everyone, close your eyes. And whoever did it, raise your hand.",
    2: "I assert that the one who was murdered was Miss Sayaka Maizono!",
    3: "there was some kind of sharp object thrust into her stomach.",
    4: "Without a doubt, that is the murder weapon!",
    5: "It is a problem! A boy and a girl spending the night together? It's... it's... unwholesome!",
    6: "Wha-? You are? Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!",
    7: "Then the person who took the knife was the victim herself!",
    8: "But are you sure we can decide something so important based solely on the absence of some hair?",
    9: "Then there would've been a lock on the door, and they would've had to break through!",
    10: "Well then, why don't we just vote right now? Majority rules!",
    11: "It's fine, it's fine. Just ask your question.",
    12: "I don't think so, that seems way too convenient.",
    13: "Negative! If you remember, Monokuma made it quite clear that the locks are all unpickable.",
    14: "What happened then was probably...",
    15: "Whoever she invited over came in and attacked her!",
    16: "We figured it out! We know who did it! Whoever she invited over is the culprit!",
    17: "I got it! Because she got hit with the sword, right there on her wrist!",
    18: "I think I get it. So here's how it all played out.",
    19: "The culprit came in, found the kitchen knife hidden there somewhere,",
    20: "Then they took the knife and attacked Sayaka before she knew what was happening!",
    21: "So she grabbed the sword to defend herself, but then the culprit took that from her too!",
    22: "Then, after they broke her wrist with the sword, they took the knife and finished it.",
    23: "So anyway, if Sayaka never touched the sword, then that means...",
    24: "The killer is the only one who used the sword.",
    25: "But hold on! If that's right, then the one who damaged the sheath with the kitchen knife was-",
    26: "Very well. Then let's review all the clues we've found up to this point one more time.",
    27: "I see. She broke her right wrist during the fight, so she'd have to use her left hand to right.",
    28: "That's because the culprit didn't know it was your room! They thought they were in Sayaka's room!"

    1: "According to the Monokuma file, the killer used a blunt instrument, but",
    2: "What kind of blunt instrument could it have been?",
    3: "Interesting.",
    4: "That certainly would make for a powerful weapon.",
    5: "She was acting funny, that's for sure. That melancholy tone of hers completely disappeared.",
    6: "Toko, what happened to you?",
    7: "Huh?",
    8: "So, are you saying the other difference has to do with how the body was arranged?",
    9: "So since Chihiro was a girl and not an adorable little man, you wouldn't kill her?",
    10: "*Groans*",
    11: "I have no idea what's going on anymore. Could such a heinous villain really be innocent?",
    12: "Well Byakuya, what's your response?",
    13: "That's right! It absolutely was!",
    14: "Then Byakuya must be the one who took the extension cord. I can't imagine any other possibility.",
    15: "He kept calling this a game, right? So he'd be totally willing to do something like this to win!",
    16: "Hey, don't just move on without permission. What do you mean she was killed somewhere else?",
    17: "What?",
    18: "Ah! I've got it!",
    19: "She must have hacked her e-handbook!",
    20: "She was the ultimate programmer, after all.",
    21: "I'm sure that would've been no problem for her.",
    22: "So then, she must have hacked hers like I said. She used her ultimate programmer skills and-",
    23: "Okay, then. I vote for Byakuya.",
    24: "What are you talking about? What other way is there?",
    25: "We've already searched this place top to bottom! What are you trying to pull, missy?",
    26: "It's probably best if I don't run my hands all over a girl's dead body.",
    27: "Th-th-then...",
    28: "Then it's really true?!",
    29: "So Chihiro really was killed in the boys' locker room?",
    30: "Well, I find it very hard to believe!",
    31: "Do you not have a mind of your own?",
    32: "Well, clues are one thing, but-",
    33: "Did nobody get a look at the killer?",
    34: "Whatever! Just hurry up and tell us!",
    35: "A track jacket and a duffel bag? But we didn't find anything like that at the murder scene.",
    36: "S-seriously?",
    37: "Even if we had the equipment for that, we wouldn't know how to use it.",
    38: "I got it! He picked that tracksuit because...",
    39: "It matched the one the culprit was wearing!",
    40: "I'm sure he saw the clothes at some point in the investigation.",
    41: "Yeah! He would never do something like that! This is a false accusation!",
    42: "Wow, interesting. I learned one new fact today.",
    43: "*Gasps*",
    44: "Why? Why do you keep accusing him?",
    45: "No, wait, hold on! You've got it all wrong! He would never kill-",
    46: "I don't accept this. Show me the proof! The actual solid proof!",
    47: "See? Look!",
    48: "Makoto was wrong after all!",
    49: "Mondo wouldn't hurt a fly!",
    50: "What the heck are you talking about?!",
    51: "What's wrong, bro? C-come on! Tell him he's wrong!",
    52: "You are wrong! You have to be wrong!",
    53: "Everything you just said is wrong! You made it all up!",
    54: "Wait! No, this can't be right!",
    55: "\"Where's your evidence?\" \"Yeah, where's your evidence?\"",
    56: "You need evidence! You need proof!",
    57: "Without any proof, you can't pin any of this on him!",
    58: "Bro? Bro? What are you saying?",
    59: "Wait! Hold on!",
    60: "Thank you.",
    61: "Thank you.",
