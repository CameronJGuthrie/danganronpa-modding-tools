    1: "We have been waiting, waiting so very long for peasants like you to appear.",
    2: "If you swear your fealty to us, we will reward you with half of the entire world!",
    3: "We've even drawn up the deed already. We will grant you honor, status, in some of our home cooking.",
    4: "Have you made your choice? Will you serve under us?",
    5: "Oh. Did you think I was being serious? Sorry. I was just messing with you.",
    6: "It's been so long since I've had an audience. Even I'm not sure what kind of role I'm supposed to play.",
    7: "Anyway, looks like I've finally been set free.",
    8: "Having to play Monokuma all the time, day after day.",
    9: "it was like i was stuck in purgatory or like a slow suicide i get bored so easy you know",
    10: "Huh? What about my face?",
    11: "What's wrong with my beautiful face? People have told me I'm cuter than a hundred chihuahuas combined.",
    12: "wow, you have a pretty good memory, I guess that's why you've made it this far, huh?",
    13: "Sometimes a little lie is necessary to keep things moving along. Wouldn't you agree?",
    14: "I'm me. And Mukuro is Mukuro.",
    15: "She tried her best, but there's just no way she could have passed as the ultimate fashionista.",
    16: "Two people can never become one as long as the walls of mind and body exist.",
    17: "Not even if they're twins.",
    18: "I know, it's such a cliche, right? I'm almost embarrassed to admit it.",
    19: "So, basically, Mukuro and I had your stereotypical twin relationship.",
    20: "The older sister, tough and proud, that was Mukuro. The younger sister, smart and cute, that was...",
    21: "Me! Junko fuckin' Anishima!",
    22: "And together, we were the Despair Sisters, aka the Ultimate Despair!",
    23: "Like I said, I get bored easy as hell. I even get fucking bored with myself.",
    24: "Ugh, that again? You have any idea how many times people ask me that shit?",
    25: "Maybe it's new to your dumbass, but it bores me to tears. Answering the same questions over and over?",
    26: "Just make up whatever answer you want, I don't give a shit! The truth's fucking lame anyway!",
    27: "And for reasons deeper and darker than the ocean. Ha! As if!",
    28: "Well, I suppose I'd better explain.",
    29: "For my plan to work, someone had to be able to control the killing game from behind the scenes.",
    30: "The so-called mastermind had to operate Monokuma, keep an eye on everyone, things like that.",
    31: "But after looking at the situation, I determined it would be impossible for Mukuro to perform such duties.",
    32: "Because naturally, she turned out to be the letdown of the family.",
    33: "leaving me behind to run off and join some band of mercenaries. Such a disappointment.",
    34: "So, I decided to play the role of director and have her join the rest of you in your school life.",
    35: "I could have let her work alongside me, but she would have been useless to me that way.",
    36: "Besides, 15 students seemed like a solid number to start with.",
    37: "Of course, the fact that she was the ultimate soldier posed something of a problem.",
    38: "She had what I call the three atrocities. Atrociously rank, atrociously filthy, atrociously repulsive.",
    39: "It was atrociously clear just how out of touch she was with the rest of society.",
    40: "Meanwhile, my ultimate fashionista status has an undeniable appeal that I didn't want to go to waste.",
    41: "Sadly, her inability to match my personality was even greater than I'd calculated. It was a lost cause.",
    42: "She was nothing more than a bit player, an extra unworthy of lines.",
    43: "Being the utter disappointment that she was, anyone would have expected her to get killed off right away.",
    44: "Which is precisely why I killed her. To meet everyone's expectations.",
    45: "Well, no, of course not. I also did it to avoid becoming bored.",
    46: "I've never been a stickler for following a plan to the letter, you know?",
    47: "If I planned everything out and knew just what was gonna happen, that'd be so boring!",
    48: "So, I changed things just a bit and decided to use Mukuro to make a little point.",
    49: "So, you figured it out?",
    50: "Well, you're right! There's no way Mukuro could have pulled off such a convincing performance.",
    51: "But she did teach you all a very valuable lesson, don't you think?",
    52: "What? I sacrificed her? That's what's got you so hot under the collar?",
    53: "Geez, misunderstandings sure are scary.",
    54: "We were the ultimate despair, you know? So we never had any kind of hope or expectations.",
    55: "Nope. I felt despair as long as I can remember, like I never should have been born at all.",
    56: "When I was born, I cried tears of total despair.",
    57: "So that's why for us, it's not a big deal whether we die or kill.",
    58: "We're just those kinds of people. We can do anything!",
    59: "We've always been filled with despair, so when we do something, we go all the way and live without regret!",
    60: "That's not true at all.",
    61: "We were twins. How could I not be sad?",
    62: "That's why it gets me so... excited.",
    63: "killing my precious sister with my own two hands.",
    64: "That act is filled with so much despair, you can't help but put a super in front of it.",
    65: "It's like, super, super, super, super, super despair. No, more than that.",
    66: "Super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super despair.",
    67: "It just feels so good.",
    68: "And my sister too. In that moment of death, I think she must have felt that despair.",
    69: "After all, to be murdered by your own sister, and only as an example to someone else?",
    70: "She must have died feeling such excruciating hopelessness.",
    71: "I'm so jealous of her. Super jealous.",
    72: "You're saying I don't compare to some lowly beast that can only kill the weak, right?",
    73: "So I'm hopelessly attractive, hopelessly brilliant, hopelessly athletic.",
    74: "I'm the hopelessly perfect ultimate human.",
    75: "Don't you mean, had that noble blood?",
    76: "Hahahaha! You still haven't figured that part out yet? Man, you guys are so slow!",
    77: "You haven't even solved all the mysteries, and yet here you are, yap-yap-yapping away!",
    78: "\"You've already solved this mystery, right? I'm the killer! So how about the next one?\"",
    79: "Maybe you should solve the riddle of your missing memories. Then you can start gloating.",
    80: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I can't wait!",
    81: "Huuuuuuuuuuu!",
    82: "Your brains are like sponges, all drippy and leaky. I already gave you a hint before.",
    83: "All the memories you lost share something in common with a few other things. Do you recall?",
    84: "so you do remember after all well i would hope you wouldn't forget something so important",
    85: "it was stupid of me to even ask. I apologize from the bottom of my heart for my bad manners.",
    86: "So then, let me ask you another question.",
    87: "Did you notice that each motive I presented you had a specific theme to it?",
    88: "Yep, you got it. So that's my question to you all.",
    89: "When Sayaka was murdered, what was the theme of the motive I presented?",
    90: "Ding, ding, ding. You got it. Remember those DVDs I gave you guys?",
    91: "Each video showed the total destruction of your most important relationships.",
    92: "For example, your family.",
    93: "For example, your friends.",
    94: "I ruined all those relationships and showed you the results.",
    95: "It was to motivate your desire to escape and kickstart your urge to kill.",
    96: "But still, what a cruel thing to do.",
    97: "Yes, well, I'm perfectly happy to accept your disapproval.",
    98: "Okay, time for the next question.",
    99: "Um, so, what was the theme for the second motive?",
    100: "Yay! Makoto got it right again! That time, the theme was...",
    101: "EMBARRASSING MEMORIES AND SECRETS! YAAAAAAA-HA-HA-HA!",
    102: "And the whole reason Mondo did what he did was to protect his secret.",
    103: "Relax, relax. Okay, on to the next question.",
    104: "So, what was the motive for the third murder?",
    105: "Seek and destroy! Hell yeah, you got it again!",
    106: "Goddamn straight it was money. Celeste killed Hifumi and Taka for a little personal gain.",
    107: "Her greed led to all kinds of death and destruction.",
    108: "Don't worry, sweet cheeks. Just one more to go.",
    109: "Now, can you tell me the motive behind Crazy-Ass Sakura's crazy-ass death?",
    110: "Precisely. You see.",
    111: "Once I revealed Sakura's betrayal, that led to everything that came afterwards.",
    112: "Anyway, it looks like you answered all of my questions correctly. How painfully delightful.",
    113: "Relationships? Secrets? Money? Betrayal?",
    114: "\"These are all pretty standard motives, right? The most normal of normal? Totally middle of the road!\"",
    115: "But of course, those aren't the only motives that exist in this world.",
    116: "In fact, there are as many reasons to kill as there are people on Earth.",
    117: "They compel humans to kill each other, bringing despair to the world!",
    118: "This is what we refer to as the Seed of Despair.",
    119: "Just as water, air, and food promote growth in living things, the seed of despair also needs nourishment.",
    120: "And that nourishment is hope. Despair can grow only in the presence of hope.",
    121: "Two sides of the same coin, divided by a razor-thin line. Such is hope and despair.",
    122: "If you would listen, you would see I'm not changing the subject. We are discussing your memories.",
    123: "What I'm trying to say is, the seed of despair is closely tied to your own memories.",
    124: "You see, by taking away your memories, I gave you hope.",
    125: "Of course that hope merely existed to be consumed by despair.",
    126: "Is that so? All you've been able to think about during your time here is how to escape, right?",
    127: "The mere fact that that's what you want proves I gave you hope.",
    128: "If none of you wanted to escape this school, the killings never would have taken place.",
    129: "That is why we took your memories, so that you would have the desire to leave.",
    130: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Correctamundo!",
    131: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! A most troubling thought, isn't it?",
    132: "But it's not enough. I want more distress, more despair.",
    133: "I put so much effort into creating hope in order to feed your despair and make it grow.",
    134: "So, just like Crazy Eddie slashing his prices and passing the savings on to you, let me give you a hint!",
    135: "Okey-dokey! Like they say, seeing is believing!",
    136: "I'd like for you to see the outside world.",
    137: "Now are you interested in what I have to say? You wanna see what's out there?",
    138: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I wanna see too!",
    139: "See your faces sink into despair.",
    140: "Ha ha ha ha ha! Now then, open Sesame!",
    141: "Behold! The world beyond the school walls!",
    142: "This is the outside world you've all been so anxious to claw your way back into.",
    143: "dangerous. The world has grown so very dangerous. That's what this means.",
    144: "What you just saw, all of you should recognize it.",
    145: "That world is locked away within the memories that were taken from you.",
    146: "If you can't remember, please just try. Do your best to try and recall.",
    147: "Ha ha ha ha! Better kick your brain in the ass! Cause it's up to that grey lump whether you live or die!",
    148: "I don't remember. Ain't a fucking excuse no more. Cause now it's time?",
    149: "For the final class trial!",
    150: "Come on, bitches! Remember or die!",
    151: "WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED OUTSIDE?!",
    152: "The video that's playing right now.",
    153: "Oh, um, I'm the mastermind.",
    154: "Uh, nice to meet you too.",
    155: "The world's been destroyed, get it?",
    156: "Okay, okay, that's enough of your little lover's quarrel.",
    157: "Whatever happened, it doesn't matter at this exact point in time, right?",
    158: "The end justifies the means. Everything serves the outcome. In other words,",
    159: "the world has ended. That's the important thing.",
    160: "Calm down, it's okay. There is no need to panic.",
    161: "Every living person will be dead in a hundred years anyway, so the world ending isn't that big a deal.",
    162: "Well, as long as we're being ridiculous, I have another ridiculous story to tell you.",
    163: "It's the story of the Togami Corporation, which has given Byakuya's life all its meaning.",
    164: "I'm glad to see you took the bait.",
    165: "You bit into it like a middle-aged secretary at an all-you-can-eat cake buffet.",
    166: "Hey, hey! So, what do you think happened to the Togami family, hm?",
    167: "Correct! Well done, peasant!",
    168: "I just got so fucking bored waiting, I couldn't help it!",
    169: "Even if you're wrong, eventually you'll figure it out, right? Till then, you're just going in circles.",
    170: "So, no matter what you pick, you get the right answer. Pretty innovative, don't you think?",
    171: "But... do you think it might be a disease? Getting bored so easy, I mean. Do you think I might be... sick?",
    172: "Anyway, like I was saying, Byakuya's entire lineage has been totally annihilated!",
    173: "I can confirm that his entire family has died. Even the distant relatives. The Tagami name has perished.",
    174: "Stop? And said with such authority, a peasant would dare challenge us, the avatar of divine punishment?",
    175: "You must learn your place, peasant. You are no longer the ultimate affluent progeny.",
    176: "\"Hell, there IS no world anymore, remember? It got fucked a full year ago!\"",
    177: "Huh? I don't make sense?",
    178: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Have you considered the possibility that you're mistaken about that?",
    179: "Well, if I'm understanding you right...",
    180: "It sounds like you think the tragedy happened a year before you arrived here.",
    181: "A few weeks ago...",
    182: "Oh, I get it. You're saying that what happened two years ago actually happened more recently, right?",
    183: "Well, I mean, you guys all started attending Hope's Peak Academy two years ago.",
    184: "I understand why you'd have trouble accepting it, but in the end, you can't deny the truth.",
    185: "And the truth is, everything is cause and effect. Deny that, and you may as well give yourself up to God.",
    186: "So, you must surely understand all the hints I've given you so far, right?",
    187: "What are the memories I took from you?",
    188: "Come now, answer us. Answer with all your heart and soul.",
    189: "Gah! Another correct answer! Well done, peasant!",
    190: "That's right. You've already spent two full years here at Hope's Peak Academy.",
    191: "And that entire period of time is precisely what you've forgotten.",
    192: "Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Everyone's so conflicted!",
    193: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! After seeing all the evidence, do you have any choice but to acknowledge the truth?",
    194: "Isn't it just so desperately dark? The mystery's solved, but it's like a goddamn funeral in here!",
    195: "Shit, man, I've never been to a funeral. Hell yes!",
    196: "Two years of school life, how many moments of blossoming youth have you missed out on?",
    197: "how many fun classes, how many school events. This was your chance to build lasting friendships, right?",
    198: "And on top of that, something tragically sad happened one year ago.",
    199: "The biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history.",
    200: "Right before everyone's eyes, the world came crashing down.",
    201: "You absorbed all that despair, but then you forgot it all.",
    202: "And once you'd forgotten, you made the choice to subject yourselves to this killing game.",
    203: "\"Oh, and there's one other thing. To be even more precise, the memories you all lost were...\"",
    204: "Actually, never mind. I'm bored. Explaining stuff is boring.",
    205: "We are bored of this world.",
    206: "Everyone always talks big, declaring all the great things they'll do, but then they always fizzle out.",
    207: "THIS WORLD IS JUST SO DESPERATELY FUCKING BORING!",
    208: "In a way, I'm jealous of all of you.",
    209: "To give yourself over so completely to such stimulating despair?",
    210: "Yeah, so figure out the rest for yourselves. I'm sick of expositioning all this shit!",
    211: "Figure out where your memories come apart. That's at the heart of all of this.",
    212: "Wow, you still have enough spirit to keep on talking, huh?",
    213: "Um, so I don't know much about the details, but it seems like everyone remembers passing out, right?",
    214: "And your sense of time got all messed up because of the memory loss after that?",
    215: "I guess it must have been something like that.",
    216: "But instead, two whole years had gone by!",
    217: "You got it, honey! Two years of memories? Poof! Gone! Which means, of course...",
    218: "When everyone met for the first time, it wasn't actually for the first time.",
    219: "Unaware of this fact, you took the time to introduce yourselves to each other, but...",
    220: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yep, that's what they reveal!",
    221: "You were all such close friends. You spent two years together. And then you started killing each other.",
    222: "And it was all so you could escape into a world that's already been annihilated!",
    223: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! What a terribly tragic tale! Even if you left now, there's nothing you could do to fix it!",
    224: "I love you all so much.",
    225: "Once your school life here began, I thought about you constantly.",
    226: "it's only natural that I would fall in love.",
    227: "So, since I love you guys so much, I'll tell you all about it!",
    228: "All about the idea we came up with as the ultimate despair! Our plan to bring despair to all mankind!",
    229: "Let's go back in time two years, okay?",
    230: "Back to when everyone first came to this school.",
    231: "School life during that first year overflowed with hope and happiness.",
    232: "Oh boy, it was just the worst!",
    233: "Everyone was enjoying themselves so much. You were all having the time of your lives.",
    234: "But that couldn't last forever, of course. The peacefulness only made it through that first year.",
    235: "Because after that, an event unfolded that hammered a soul-crushing despair into all of humanity.",
    236: "The biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history. The tragedy.",
    237: "All too soon, the world's days of peace came to a bloody end.",
    238: "And as you can imagine, the school was no exception.",
    239: "The tragedy even made its way here, leading to the extermination of most of the students.",
    240: "Hm? What do you mean?",
    241: "You have a point. If I had to describe it, I'd say,",
    242: "it was none of those, how can I put it, it was more of an ideological thing.",
    243: "Despair is contagious, you know? It's almost like a natural phenomenon.",
    244: "Everyone is capable of it.",
    245: "And now the entire world has fallen into despair.",
    246: "In other words, if you see despair as the enemy, then your enemy is the world itself.",
    247: "We didn't ask you to try to understand. This was a tangent anyway, unrelated to the matter at hand.",
    248: "Okay, so let's get back to the story.",
    249: "Hope's peak had taken so much damage. You guys were the only survivors.",
    250: "The members of the 78th Class of Hope's Peak Academy were the only ones left.",
    251: "And then, something super neat happened!",
    252: "Now pay attention, because this is important, and I'm only going to say it once.",
    253: "So guess what? To protect everyone who had survived, Hope's Peak was transformed into a shelter!",
    254: "That's right! It was transformed into a shelter!",
    255: "Ah, I said it twice!",
    256: "Now, someone was responsible for that transformation, for creating what would eventually become your prison.",
    257: "Do any of you know who that might have been?",
    258: "We believe he had something like that in mind, yes.",
    259: "If you, the collective hope of a new generation, could survive, maybe the world could have a fresh start.",
    260: "Yeah, the headmaster put that much faith in you.",
    261: "But creating the shelter was also his single biggest mistake.",
    262: "Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It's laughable, really. He was the headmaster, but he had no idea.",
    263: "He had no idea that we, the ultimate despair, had already made our way into the school.",
    264: "So what was supposed to be a shelter to keep you safe?",
    265: "Became a cage that made it impossible for you to escape despair.",
    266: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I have to say, it really helped me out a lot. It saved me a ton of time!",
    267: "By the way, it was you yourselves who blocked off the windows, the doors, all the exits.",
    268: "Under the headmaster's direction, you all went about your work like obedient little sheep.",
    269: "And then you forgot all about it and started bitching about how you were trapped in here.",
    270: "Once you'd finished building your little shelter, it was time for me and Mukuro to get to work.",
    271: "And thus began the killing game!",
    272: "Me and Mukuro had come here, spending the last two years waiting for that moment.",
    273: "That moment where you all began killing each other served as the climax of our global despair plan!",
    274: "And the only reason you survived the tragedy was so that you could be a part of it.",
    275: "Because this was so much more than a simple high school deathmatch.",
    276: "Rather, it was a method to hunt down and destroy every last remaining speck of hope in the world.",
    277: "Well, it would seem that there's a little bit left out there, a few souls unwilling to give up hope.",
    278: "So I thought I should show them, which is why I-",
    279: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Well, why don't you tell me?",
    280: "Uh-huh. That's exactly what I'm talking about.",
    281: "To show the world the murders taking place at this school, which was meant to be a symbol of hope.",
    282: "That was the whole point of the Ultimate Despair! When I said \"climax\", THAT was what I was talking about!",
    283: "The world watched as you fell into despair and began to kill each other one after another.",
    284: "Despair is as contagious as any disease. Any hope left turns to despair.",
    285: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Isn't the power of television just amazing?",
    286: "By the way, since we started broadcasting, a whole bunch of people have tried to come and rescue you.",
    287: "but utilizing the heavy weaponry I installed around the school grounds, I had no problem expelling them.",
    288: "I have to thank you all.",
    289: "They were a relentless bunch, refusing to give up on hope and trying to force their beliefs on the world.",
    290: "But in the end, I was able to give them the final despair. Death.",
    291: "Well, sure, but I also gave you a second chance at life, right? So it's like, give and take!",
    292: "And there's a reason I chose you guys to survive when all the other students were dropping like flies!",
    293: "I mean, we built up two years of memories together. You were all my treasured classmates.",
    294: "Sorry, that's a lie. I just figured you'd despair even more when you found out a friend had betrayed you.",
    295: "And that's the truth, which is what you wanted, right? So, does it make you feel utterly lost and hopeless?",
    296: "You solved the mystery, but despair at the truth, right?",
    297: "And if we did, then what?",
    298: "Our final desire for creating this world of despair was so we could experience one last class trial.",
    299: "If you were bold enough to solve the mystery, only to discover that the truth was utterly hopeless...",
    300: "How would you react? What would you do?",
    301: "See, discovering the truth doesn't necessarily lead to a sense of hope.",
    302: "Truth can be full of despair, too. Like right fucking now!",
    303: "Not to mention, all those motives I talked about were totally meaningless.",
    304: "I mean, with the world having ended and all.",
    305: "And think about it. You chose to lock yourselves up here, then started murdering each other to get out.",
    306: "A peasant begging for his life? Oh, how delightful! We've never witnessed such a travesty firsthand.",
    307: "But I'm sorry to say, begging doesn't work on me.",
    308: "All I want is despair, and there's no reason for it.",
    309: "And since there's no reason, there's no argument against it. There's just no understanding it.",
    310: "No argument, no understanding. What better definition of ultimate despair could there be?",
    311: "Huh?",
    312: "Until you see it with your own eyes, truth and falsehood overlap one another.",
    313: "In other words, you're not unlike Schrodinger's cat right now. Is that what you're saying?",
    314: "If so, what then?",
    315: "Are you saying you won't accept the truth until you can go outside and see for yourself?",
    316: "Well, you better not. You go out into that world and you're all gunners for sure.",
    317: "Trust me, I'm not lying about any of this.",
    318: "Huh? Everyone I've killed?",
    319: "What are you talking about? You're the ones who killed them!",
    320: "I didn't kill anyone. I simply gave you a little nudge in the right direction.",
    321: "And that's all it took for you to start killing each other. You're nothing but bloodthirsty animals.",
    322: "That's why anyone was murdered here, peasant.",
    323: "Say what you want about hope, but we're all creatures of instinct, right? Despair comes naturally!",
    324: "Hell yes! That's funny as shit!",
    325: "You certainly have a talent for passing the buck, don't you? That must be your hope, huh?",
    326: "but we don't have much time left to keep up this banter. We have to draw things to a close soon.",
    327: "\"I'm talking about the vote, of course. You didn't forget about that little rule, did you?\"",
    328: "Oh, and also, since this will be the last vote, I decided to change the rules!",
    329: "You guys so full of hope, and me so full of despair.",
    330: "I've decided to have you vote which one will be punished!",
    331: "If even one of you votes to punish Hope, well then...",
    332: "I'll consider that a win for me and punish everyone on the side of hope.",
    333: "Oh, but don't worry. I won't be voting, of course.",
    334: "Oh, let me just mention one more thing when I win to punish you guys.",
    335: "You'll have to stay here till you grow old and die. No fighting, no killing. That's your punishment.",
    336: "If you're not happy with that, then go ahead and punish me, and make your way to the outside world.",
    337: "Enter a world fallen from grace, where only despair exists, where you'd likely be dead within a day.",
    338: "Wait a sec, I just got hit with an inspiration bomb!",
    339: "\"Dying of old age is boring as shit, right? The audience at home isn't gonna dig that at all!\"",
    340: "So, here's what'll happen! One of you will get to experience an instant, super impressive punishment!",
    341: "And I get to decide who's gonna have to suck it down!",
    342: "Makoto, you're up!",
    343: "Yeah, you've been acting up, causing all kinds of trouble. I hate you!",
    344: "So let me make this clear. Everyone has two choices in front of them.",
    345: "If a single person votes for Hope to be punished,",
    346: "Then only Makoto will receive a harsh punishment, and the rest of you will live here in peace.",
    347: "If, on the other hand, you desire to see us punished, then you must all leave this place.",
    348: "I will force you out, ensuring you all die horrible deaths in the outside world.",
    349: "What I'm saying is, if you sacrifice Makoto, the rest of you will get to live out your lives!",
    350: "What? Has your resolve softened? Have you lost confidence? Are you afraid of being punished?",
    351: "Don't you have faith in your friends?",
    352: "It's okay. You're right to be afraid.",
    353: "It would seem all of those around you have realized the futility of going against me.",
    354: "It's so beautiful. Your lovely faces, eroded by despair, have come together as one.",
    355: "Besides, Kyoko, you could never betray your father, could you?",
    356: "I mean, the headmaster's only wish was that all of you would survive, right?",
    357: "That's why he tried to trap you all here after all.",
    358: "The least you can do is try to honor your dead father's wishes.",
    359: "One person's despair is enough to seal your fate. Isn't that just the most hopeless outcome ever?",
    360: "So, who do you think's gonna give in? Whose despair is gonna sign your death warrant?",
    361: "So boring. Stubborn till the very end, huh?",
    362: "Well, that's fine. Then let's just hurry up and get it over with.",
    363: "It's time for the final vote. Everything will come to an end. Your stupid hope.",
    364: "AND YOUR STUPID LIFE!",
    365: "If I were to die,",
    366: "That would be the end of Hope's Peak Academy.",
    367: "By the way, the air outside is totally polluted, you know.",
    368: "The only reason we're okay in here...",
    369: "is thanks to the air purifiers in the Physics Lab.",
    370: "If I die, the purifiers will screech to a halt.",
    371: "In other words, as soon as I die?",
    372: "The communal life you've all been living will come to an end.",
    373: "All of you will have to leave.",
    374: "You'll have to go into the world outside, where only death and despair are waiting.",
    375: "So, what are you gonna do?",
    376: "Will you just die? Is that what you want?",
    377: "W-what the...?",
    378: "What the hell are you?",
    379: "So uncool!",
    380: "Your stupid faces, the stupid things you've said, the stupid way you all treat each other!",
    381: "It's all so uncool! So unhip!",
    382: "SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP",
    383: "Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame!",
    384: "What's going on?",
    385: "WHAT'S HAPPENING?!",
