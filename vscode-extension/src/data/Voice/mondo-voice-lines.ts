    2: "so the killer used some random knife they had on him.",
    3: "How could anyone do something like that? That son of a bitch!",
    4: "Huh? A kitchen knife?",
    5: "Oh, yeah. I guess that makes sense. You could sort of see the weapon sticking out of her stomach.",
    6: "And if you look real close, I could totally see that being a kitchen knife.",
    7: "Then there's no way anyone would work together, right?",
    8: "Just spit it out already.",
    9: "Bewildering? What the hell are you talking about?",
    10: "Wait, then that means...",
    11: "Yeah, then they ran after her, got into the bathroom, and stabbed her.",
    12: "Then the killer ran after her.",
    13: "And they got into the bathroom.",
    14: "Okay, then who did do it?",
    15: "But we still don't know who it is, you goddamn idiot!",
    16: "Oh yeah, what's the deal with that sword?",
    17: "Stop jumping ahead! Slow down and explain it so I get what the hell's going on!",
    18: "That's true. With the sheath on, it'd be heavy and bulky and useless as shit.",
    19: "So all that's why she switched the names?",
    20: "Holy shit!",
    21: "Hey, Chihiro, you're a computer nerd or whatever, right? You should know all about numbers and shit.",
    22: "Huh? What? What?",
    23: "Whoa, you might have finally just said something worth a shit.",
    24: "What is it, some kind of glass ball? It's busted to hell.",
    25: "I mean, it had to be a screwdriver, right?"

    3: "No fucking way!",
    4: "What the fuck is this?",
    5: "The hell is wrong with you?",
    6: "But the body really was suspended, right? And nobody but the police knew about that.",
    7: "Hey Byakuya, where'd you get it from, huh?",
    8: "Hell yes, that's what happened. So that's it, right? Byakuya's the killer.",
    9: "What the? You finally decide to open your mouth and that's what you've got to say?",
    10: "There's no way she could get in the boys' locker room, right?",
    11: "What?",
    12: "Are you fucking with us right now?",
    13: "Who is it? Who's the killer?",
    14: "So, what you're saying is...",
    15: "The killer was wearing the same blue tracksuit as him?",
    16: "My tracksuit is black!",
    17: "No way. Not a chance.",
    18: "Huh? What'd I say?",
    19: "What are you... you just...",
    20: "Because I... I just...",
    21: "Just by chance. I just happened to see it last night.",
    22: "He walked past me, and he was carrying the tracksuit in his hands.",
    23: "Nyah! Nyah!",
    24: "Gah!",
    25: "I... I... I, I, I, I, I, uh...",
    26: "I didn't kill anyone!",
    27: "You've been all over me, judging everything I say, putting words in my mouth.",
    28: "What gives you the right to treat me like a goddamn criminal?!",
    29: "W-What?",
    30: "UGH! UGH!",
    31: "Well, my goddamn handbook works just fine!",
    32: "The fuck is that supposed to mean?",
    33: "S-son of a bitch!",
    34: "Gah... Gah...",
    35: "We don't got to do that.",
    36: "Yeah. Yeah.",
    37: "I did it. I killed him.",
    38: "I got no choice, man. After hearing all that, I gotta just... give up.",
    39: "Go ahead, Monokuma. Get it over with.",
    40: "Ask for the goddamn verdict.",
    41: "Thank you.",
    42: "Thank you.",
    43: "Thank you.",
    44: "Thank you."
