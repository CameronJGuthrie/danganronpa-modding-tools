    1: "So it seems most likely that...",
    2: "The killer must have taken her by surprise while she was in the bathroom.",
    3: "She didn't even have a chance to resist.",
    4: "A struggle? Between who and who?",
    5: "So you're saying, Sayaka wasn't caught by surprise in the bathroom?",
    6: "S-sorry.",
    7: "But what if they did work together, and they just didn't know about the rule?",
    8: "Okay, so then, who did take the knife?",
    9: "We're not allowed to sleep anywhere but the dorms, but it doesn't say we have to stay in our assigned room.",
    10: "So, I don't think that's a problem.",
    11: "So, the culprit removed some evidence?",
    12: "Then... Makoto isn't the culprit?",
    13: "Oh, yeah, true. But what does it mean?",
    14: "And finally, the culprit had Sayaka cornered.",
    15: "Then why didn't your bathroom door open?",
    16: "So the killer would have to be someone who didn't know they'd switched rooms?",
    17: "But what happens if we can't decide on who we think did it?",
    18: "Then, maybe someone picked the lock?",
    19: "Huh? What makes you say that?",
    20: "I see. So if someone read that note,",
    21: "then they would have gone to Sayaka's room.",
    22: "Then, if someone did do what the note said, they would end up at Makoto's room where Sayaka was.",
    23: "But why would she switch them in the first place?",
    24: "Is... is that gold?",
    25: "But then the culprit took that from her, too.",
    26: "Something sharp? You mean like the kitchen knife? That was the only sharp thing found at the scene.",
    27: "But, we already said that the attack started with...",
    28: "No, that's not... Yes, I'm a programmer, but I don't see any kind of meaning in these numbers.",
    29: "Ah, you're right. The connecting line is barely there, so I assumed it was 1-1, but...",
    30: "Looking at it now, you could also read it as an N.",
    31: "Yeah, I mean, Leon's not the only one wearing a white button-up.",
    32: "But how would you use it?",
    33: "but the distance from the gate to the incinerator has to be at least 30 feet, right?",
    34: "The pinpoint accuracy you'd need to throw a glass ball that far and hit something that small.",
    35: "Could someone really do that?",
    36: "Only the boys got toolkits, so the killer naturally assumed there wouldn't be one in there.",
    37: "Thank you.",
    38: "Thank you.",
    39: "Thank you.",
    40: "Thank you."
