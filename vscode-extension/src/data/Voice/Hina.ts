    7: "Oh, and more importantly, why would I get involved in something like that?",
    8: "No, no way! I swear it wasn't me!",
    9: "That's right. Sakura was with me the entire time I was drinking my tea.",
    10: "Actually, no. Because, um, well...",
    11: "\"I got so scared thanks to those creepy videos. I wasn't really thinking, I just asked her to stay over.\"",

    18: "Oh, yeah! Okay, so, um...",
    19: "Well, I was just wondering, how'd the culprit get into Makoto's room in the first place?",
    20: "Oh man! I've totally seen people do that on detective shows!",
    21: "When you write, it can leave an imprint. Sketch over the next sheet of paper, and you can see the words.",
    22: "When I saw that, I was like, holy crap! I better make sure I rip the paper out before I use it from now on.",
    23: "Inviting someone to your room, but not telling them you'd switched rooms. Why would anyone do that?",
    24: "Then... we just have to figure out what happened during the fight, right?",

    15: "This is all a lie! Right, Toko?",
    16: "What?",
    17: "Yeah. I could never believe a word you say, you monster!",
    18: "Yeah. That's why we figured it had to be the real deal and not some copycat killer or whatever.",
    19: "So, you said Byakuya was acting kinda weird before we found the body.",
    20: "But he was acting weird. How?",
    21: "It seems like there's no way she could have got into the boys' locker room. So I guess so.",

    35: "Sherry? Are... Are you talking about Jahiro?",
    36: "Really? What kind of evidence?",
    37: "Then it must hold some clue about the culprit, right?",
    38: "Just tell us already. Why would we want to break our own handbooks?",
    39: "But how'd they find out? Monokuma said he didn't tell anyone, right?",
    40: "But doesn't that violate the school regulation that says loaning out your handbook is prohibited?"

    7: "So? Who was in the robo-justice suit?",

    9: "What?",

    11: "Yeah, the subject of how Robo-Justice didn't do it. Because if it's not a killer robot, then...",
    12: "What kind of robot is it?",
    13: "Yeah, the culprit wrapped the body in the tarp,",
    14: "Then loaded it onto the dolly and wheeled it off, right?",
    15: "Well, yeah. But even without a handle.",
    16: "All you'd have to do is bend over.",
    17: "Then you could push the dolly, no problem.",
    18: "What do you mean?",
    19: "Now that you mention it, yeah...",
    20: "Then... you really can't take it off by yourself? Hiro wasn't just making it up.",
    21: "So, it's really, really true that Robo-Justice couldn't have moved the dolly?",
    22: "Yeah, yeah, that's got to be right.",
    23: "Plus, maybe we'll get to find out where the heck Kyoko was when everything went down.",
    24: "And as soon as we split up, Kyoko went missing.",

    37: "But I mean, we found his body. He was dead.",
    38: "Well, here's one thing we do know.",
    39: "The first time we found Hifumi's body was in the nurse's office.",
    40: "And then, while me and Celeste were in the bathroom,",
    41: "His body disappeared!",

    45: "Well, after the bodies disappeared, we all went looking for them, right?",
    46: "So me and Sakura headed for the repository.",

    48: "I... I just can't believe it.",

    50: "What? In his...",
    51: "Um, just to be clear, TikTok is Taka and Huffy is Hifumi, right?",
    52: "But if they gave the note to Taka, what was Hifumi doing with it?",
    53: "Huh? He stole it?",
    54: "Then Taka's scrap and Hifumi's note",
    55: "So then, who killed Hifumi?",
    56: "Wait, but me and Sakura were together.",
    57: "Who are you calling a walrus?",
    58: "So which hammer was used to attack Celeste? Number one or number two?",
    59: "Um, then, uh...",
    60: "Huh?",
    61: "\"And whoever did that is the true killer. The one Hifumi was working with. And the one who betrayed him!\"",
    62: "Th-that's just... awful! How could anyone be so cruel?!",
    63: "Are you saying everything they told us was a lie?",
    64: "It was to get us to divide into two groups. So that we would discover both bodies at the same time?",
    65: "I... I don't believe it! Everything... the whole thing was one big act!",
    66: "Yeah? I was feeling kind of sick, so Celeste took me to the bathroom.",
    67: "Wait! Then that was...",
    68: "\"That's right! They totally made a mistake when they made it, so it couldn't bend at the waist!\"",

    33: "What do you mean?",
    34: "Oh, so the queen is missing.",
    35: "But why would they have to try and get rid of it like that anyway?",
    36: "Then YOU killed Sakura!",
    37: "Wait, what do you mean probably?",
    38: "\"Forget all that! Why did you attack Sakura?\"",
    39: "Sakura was just worried about you, and you... You're terrible!",

    75: "F-fine.",

    36: "No, not that. I just remembered something super serious.",
    37: "You know that knife we found all black and burnt?",

    41: "It really is, isn't it? I was afraid of that.",
    42: "Then the knife...",
    43: "Oh, hey, I have a question. It kinda goes back to the beginning, but...",
    44: "What's the deal with that explosion anyway? Why'd the body just blow up all of a sudden like that?",
    45: "Well, if you're so smart, just tell me.",
    46: "I might be dumb, but even I'm not dumb enough to believe that.",
    47: "Huh? You know, I feel like I've seen something like it somewhere before.",
    48: "Oh! Then the explosion was cause of the Monokuma bomb!",
    49: "That's true! It's definitely bugging me. What really killed her?",
    50: "The explosion didn't kill her for sure, I guess.",
    51: "But then, what was the murder weapon?",

    56: "So you just murdered your own sister and didn't think anything of it?",
    57: "Huh?",
    58: "You're the one that did it!",
    59: "How could taking away someone's memories give them hope?",
    60: "Huh? Really?",
    61: "I mean, you're telling us to remember, but...",
    62: "What am I supposed to be remembering?",
    63: "Boy, she just gave in like it was nothing.",

    75: "You... expelled them?",
    76: "\"Meaningless? Then we-\"",
    77: "\"We've been murdering each other... for nothing?\"",
    78: "Even if it's just one person?",
    79: "We'd have to just live here?",
    80: "What? Y-you can't just-",
    81: "I've been thinking about all this.",
    82: "And I was thinking, at a time like this, what would Sakura do?",
    83: "You only get stronger by taking adversity by the horns. Confront that thorny path with enthusiasm!",
    84: "That sounds like something she'd say, right?",
    85: "No. I think that's definitely what she'd say.",
    86: "Which is why I... I...",
    87: "Yeah! I've made up my mind!",
    88: "*Sigh*...",
    89: "Say whatever you want. I've made my decision.",
    90: "Good! I'm ready to go!",
    91: "Thank you."
