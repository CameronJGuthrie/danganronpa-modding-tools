    12: "Huh? It'll make things more exciting?",

    18: "Yes, that certainly does make things much more exciting.",
    19: "Now let's ride this wave of excitement back to the courtroom and get back to the trial.",
    20: "Ahem. I do apologize for keeping you waiting. Now then, let's resume the class trial.",
    21: "We've all just learned of the shocking revelation that Chihiro was actually a boy. Let's pick up from there.",
    22: "Of course his handbook said he was a boy. He dressed like a girl, but he was a boy through and through.",
    23: "You're right, they're not.",

    27: "Yeah, you remember that?",
    28: "Sure, maybe I let that slip, but I never told anyone what the weak point actually was.",
    29: "Huh? You're asking me?",
    30: "But if I tell you and someone else decides to copy it, that would be very not good.",
    31: "Oh, well. I have a weakness for pushy demands. But you're sure you won't follow their example?",
    32: "Then allow me to make a special announcement. The weak point of my cutting-edge e-handbook is...",
    33: "When it's exposed to high temperatures for too long, it will suffer a meltdown and totally break!",
    34: "The temperature in the sauna can reach over 200 degrees. Strange how you don't get burnt, huh?",
    35: "It's because as your sweat evaporates, it creates a cooling layer of air around your skin.",
    36: "If the hot air of the sauna were somehow pushed directly onto your skin, you'd definitely get fried.",
    37: "That layer of air would get blown away. That's why you may feel a burning when you move around.",
    38: "So when you're in a sauna, make sure to keep nice and still.",
    39: "That's right. The punishment it suffered wasn't nearly enough to destroy it.",
    40: "Well, here's how I look at it.",
    41: "There is a rule about loaning your handbook to another student. But if they're dead, they're not a student.",
    42: "It's kind of a great area, I admit. But no worries. If anything, it just makes things more interesting.",
    43: "As such, I decree that exchanging handbooks with the corpse is not a violation of the rules.",
    44: "Roger that.",
    45: "No waiting! No holding on!",

    12: "Huh? I laid a trap?",

    31: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!",
    32: "Oh, don't mind me. I'm just getting a little impatient sitting here listening. I think I'm gonna jump in.",
    33: "Let's start off with a nice easy question.",
    34: "Your assumption that I attacked Makoto is just that, right? An assumption.",
    35: "You can't really know who was under that mask, can you? I mean, that's the whole point of a mask.",
    36: "The true identity of the masked attacker is Mukuro Ikusaba. At least, that's what I think.",
    37: "Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo! Do you have any evidence that might convince me otherwise?",
    38: "You never saw their face, right?",
    39: "So you can't have any idea who is under that mask.",
    40: "I'm telling you now, it was Mukuro Ikusaba!",
    41: "Oh? And what is this other part?",
    42: "Is it the right hand?",
    43: "Or the left hand?",
    44: "Maybe the right foot.",
    45: "Or perhaps the left foot.",
    46: "Or could it be the hips?",
    47: "Yeah, well, okay. You got me. I guess it wasn't her.",
    48: "But that still doesn't prove that it was me.",
    49: "It could have been, you know, someone else, right?",
    50: "Oh, okay, sure. It couldn't have been any of you.",
    51: "But what about Kyoko? It totally could've been her!",
    52: "Uh-oh! No snappy comeback. Did I score a bullseye?",
    53: "Huh? Show me what.",
    54: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! This is just awful!",
    55: "On top of my secret being revealed, I had to look at those positively grotesque scars of yours.",
    56: "Uh, sorry. Did I say that out loud? I do hope I didn't hurt your feelings.",
    57: "Sure, as long as it means pushing me farther into the corner, right? But I'm not cornered just yet.",
    58: "Because if you haven't noticed, the circumstances surrounding Mukuro's death are totally unknown.",
    59: "In that regard, you have nothing to worry about.",
    60: "I promise you, without a doubt, she died after our little killing game began here.",
    61: "B-B-B-That's just a wild guess!",
    62: "Where's your evidence? Prove that the body was wrapped in a tarp and moved.",
    63: "Worked up?",
    64: "La, la, la, I can't hear you. La, la, la, la, la.",

    66: "What do you think I'm talking about?",
    67: "Your family.",
    68: "Don't tell me you forgot about that video message.",
    69: "So what do you think? Are you sure your family's still okay?",
    70: "Your mom, your dad, your little sister. What do you think has happened to your family?",
    71: "Are they really as safe as you might have assumed?",
    72: "Get me out!",
    73: "What are you talking about? What about the lights?",
    74: "No, no, no. That's crazy talk. She was killed as someone else? Come on!",
    75: "Besides, who could that someone else even have been?",
    76: "NOTHING'S GONNA BECOME OBVIOUS!",
    77: "Because Kyoko's totally delusional!",

    94: "Oh?",
    95: "Afraid? What's that mean, afraid?",
    96: "Fear is only possible where hope is possible. I only have despair, so fear is an alien concept to me.",
    97: "Because it's a bunch of nonsense. Junko's my secret identity?",

    137: "You see what I mean, right, Mr. Monokuma?",
    138: "I was in the bathroom, just looking at myself in the mirror.",
    139: "That's why I'm still alive! Because I don't know! That's why I desperately cling to life!",
    140: "Well, I'm not totally sure myself. Maybe you should try reading between the lines.",
    141: "Even the darkest subject can suddenly become brighter.",
    142: "Our dreams are expanding!",
    143: "And I don't plan on ever playing it in the future either.",
    144: "Once again, happy new day!",
    145: "Sometimes, the murders that people forgive are way more abnormal than the ones they don't.",
    146: "And that's the secret origin story of Monokuma.",

    152: "Monokuma appears!",
    153: '"Wrong!"',

    155: "Okay.",

    281: "Time is utterly silent, and yet it constantly assaults us. Organisms, the Earth, natural phenomena.",
    282: "It damages us little by little until the end. You should really think about that.",
    283: "Anyway, it's time to begin the class trial.",
    284: "So, please meet up in the usual spot.",
    285: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! See you later!",

    299: "There is no night that doesn't have a dawn.",
    300: "Although that dawn is totally pitch black.",
    301: "There is no storm that won't eventually end.",
    302: "Of course, then that leads to drought!",
    303: "But as I said, every end is the promise of a new beginning.",
    304: "Which is why I'm sure we'll get to meet again. Because the end is only the beginning.",
    305: "Anyway, let's get started.",
    306: "The beginning of the end of the class trial.",
    307: "Everyone gather once again at You Know Where!",

    321: "You've received a message. A message containing a warning about the dangers of the universe.",
    322: "I wonder how many Christmases have passed since they died.",
    323: "Only the one that disturbed your peace will be punished. The rest may continue their communal life.",

    356: "Having to play Monokuma all the time, day after day.",
    357: "it was like i was stuck in purgatory or like a slow suicide i get bored so easy you know",
    358: "Huh? What about my face?",
    359: "What's wrong with my beautiful face? People have told me I'm cuter than a hundred chihuahuas combined.",
    360: "wow, you have a pretty good memory, I guess that's why you've made it this far, huh?",
    361: "Sometimes a little lie is necessary to keep things moving along. Wouldn't you agree?",
    362: "I'm me. And Mukuro is Mukuro.",
    363: "She tried her best, but there's just no way she could have passed as the ultimate fashionista.",
    364: "Two people can never become one as long as the walls of mind and body exist.",
    365: "Not even if they're twins.",
    366: "I know, it's such a cliche, right? I'm almost embarrassed to admit it.",
    367: "So, basically, Mukuro and I had your stereotypical twin relationship.",
    368: "The older sister, tough and proud, that was Mukuro. The younger sister, smart and cute, that was...",
    369: "Me! Junko fuckin' Anishima!",
    370: "And together, we were the Despair Sisters, aka the Ultimate Despair!",
    371: "Like I said, I get bored easy as hell. I even get fucking bored with myself.",
    372: "Ugh, that again? You have any idea how many times people ask me that shit?",
    373: "Maybe it's new to your dumbass, but it bores me to tears. Answering the same questions over and over?",
    374: "Just make up whatever answer you want, I don't give a shit! The truth's fucking lame anyway!",
    375: "And for reasons deeper and darker than the ocean. Ha! As if!",
    376: "Well, I suppose I'd better explain.",
    377: "For my plan to work, someone had to be able to control the killing game from behind the scenes.",
    378: "The so-called mastermind had to operate Monokuma, keep an eye on everyone, things like that.",
    379: "But after looking at the situation, I determined it would be impossible for Mukuro to perform such duties.",
    380: "Because naturally, she turned out to be the letdown of the family.",
    381: "leaving me behind to run off and join some band of mercenaries. Such a disappointment.",
    382: "So, I decided to play the role of director and have her join the rest of you in your school life.",
    383: "I could have let her work alongside me, but she would have been useless to me that way.",
    384: "Besides, 15 students seemed like a solid number to start with.",
    385: "Of course, the fact that she was the ultimate soldier posed something of a problem.",
    386: "She had what I call the three atrocities. Atrociously rank, atrociously filthy, atrociously repulsive.",
    387: "It was atrociously clear just how out of touch she was with the rest of society.",
    388: "Meanwhile, my ultimate fashionista status has an undeniable appeal that I didn't want to go to waste.",
    389: "Sadly, her inability to match my personality was even greater than I'd calculated. It was a lost cause.",
    390: "She was nothing more than a bit player, an extra unworthy of lines.",
    391: "Being the utter disappointment that she was, anyone would have expected her to get killed off right away.",
    392: "Which is precisely why I killed her. To meet everyone's expectations.",
    393: "Well, no, of course not. I also did it to avoid becoming bored.",
    394: "I've never been a stickler for following a plan to the letter, you know?",
    395: "If I planned everything out and knew just what was gonna happen, that'd be so boring!",
    396: "So, I changed things just a bit and decided to use Mukuro to make a little point.",
    397: "So, you figured it out?",
    398: "Well, you're right! There's no way Mukuro could have pulled off such a convincing performance.",
    399: "But she did teach you all a very valuable lesson, don't you think?",
    400: "What? I sacrificed her? That's what's got you so hot under the collar?",
    401: "Geez, misunderstandings sure are scary.",
    402: "We were the ultimate despair, you know? So we never had any kind of hope or expectations.",
    403: "Nope. I felt despair as long as I can remember, like I never should have been born at all.",
    404: "When I was born, I cried tears of total despair.",
    405: "So that's why for us, it's not a big deal whether we die or kill.",
    406: "We're just those kinds of people. We can do anything!",
    407: "We've always been filled with despair, so when we do something, we go all the way and live without regret!",
    408: "That's not true at all.",
    409: "We were twins. How could I not be sad?",
    410: "That's why it gets me so... excited.",
    411: "killing my precious sister with my own two hands.",
    412: "That act is filled with so much despair, you can't help but put a super in front of it.",
    413: "It's like, super, super, super, super, super despair. No, more than that.",
    414: "Super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super despair.",
    415: "It just feels so good.",
    416: "And my sister too. In that moment of death, I think she must have felt that despair.",
    417: "After all, to be murdered by your own sister, and only as an example to someone else?",
    418: "She must have died feeling such excruciating hopelessness.",
    419: "I'm so jealous of her. Super jealous.",
    420: "You're saying I don't compare to some lowly beast that can only kill the weak, right?",
    421: "So I'm hopelessly attractive, hopelessly brilliant, hopelessly athletic.",
    422: "I'm the hopelessly perfect ultimate human.",
    423: "Don't you mean, had that noble blood?",
    424: "Hahahaha! You still haven't figured that part out yet? Man, you guys are so slow!",
    425: "You haven't even solved all the mysteries, and yet here you are, yap-yap-yapping away!",
    426: "\"You've already solved this mystery, right? I'm the killer! So how about the next one?\"",
    427: "Maybe you should solve the riddle of your missing memories. Then you can start gloating.",
    428: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I can't wait!",
    429: "Huuuuuuuuuuu!",
    430: "Your brains are like sponges, all drippy and leaky. I already gave you a hint before.",
    431: "All the memories you lost share something in common with a few other things. Do you recall?",
    432: "so you do remember after all well i would hope you wouldn't forget something so important",
    433: "it was stupid of me to even ask. I apologize from the bottom of my heart for my bad manners.",
    434: "So then, let me ask you another question.",
    435: "Did you notice that each motive I presented you had a specific theme to it?",
    436: "Yep, you got it. So that's my question to you all.",
    437: "When Sayaka was murdered, what was the theme of the motive I presented?",
    438: "Ding, ding, ding. You got it. Remember those DVDs I gave you guys?",
    439: "Each video showed the total destruction of your most important relationships.",
    440: "For example, your family.",
    441: "For example, your friends.",
    442: "I ruined all those relationships and showed you the results.",
    443: "It was to motivate your desire to escape and kickstart your urge to kill.",
    444: "But still, what a cruel thing to do.",
    445: "Yes, well, I'm perfectly happy to accept your disapproval.",
    446: "Okay, time for the next question.",
    447: "Um, so, what was the theme for the second motive?",
    448: "Yay! Makoto got it right again! That time, the theme was...",
    449: "EMBARRASSING MEMORIES AND SECRETS! YAAAAAAA-HA-HA-HA!",
    450: "And the whole reason Mondo did what he did was to protect his secret.",
    451: "Relax, relax. Okay, on to the next question.",
    452: "So, what was the motive for the third murder?",
    453: "Seek and destroy! Hell yeah, you got it again!",
    454: "Goddamn straight it was money. Celeste killed Hifumi and Taka for a little personal gain.",
    455: "Her greed led to all kinds of death and destruction.",
    456: "Don't worry, sweet cheeks. Just one more to go.",
    457: "Now, can you tell me the motive behind Crazy-Ass Sakura's crazy-ass death?",
    458: "Precisely. You see.",
    459: "Once I revealed Sakura's betrayal, that led to everything that came afterwards.",
    460: "Anyway, it looks like you answered all of my questions correctly. How painfully delightful.",
    461: "Relationships? Secrets? Money? Betrayal?",
    462: '"These are all pretty standard motives, right? The most normal of normal? Totally middle of the road!"',
    463: "But of course, those aren't the only motives that exist in this world.",
    464: "In fact, there are as many reasons to kill as there are people on Earth.",
    465: "They compel humans to kill each other, bringing despair to the world!",
    466: "This is what we refer to as the Seed of Despair.",
    467: "Just as water, air, and food promote growth in living things, the seed of despair also needs nourishment.",
    468: "And that nourishment is hope. Despair can grow only in the presence of hope.",
    469: "Two sides of the same coin, divided by a razor-thin line. Such is hope and despair.",
    470: "If you would listen, you would see I'm not changing the subject. We are discussing your memories.",
    471: "What I'm trying to say is, the seed of despair is closely tied to your own memories.",
    472: "You see, by taking away your memories, I gave you hope.",
    473: "Of course that hope merely existed to be consumed by despair.",
    474: "Is that so? All you've been able to think about during your time here is how to escape, right?",
    475: "The mere fact that that's what you want proves I gave you hope.",
    476: "If none of you wanted to escape this school, the killings never would have taken place.",
    477: "That is why we took your memories, so that you would have the desire to leave.",
    478: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Correctamundo!",
    479: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! A most troubling thought, isn't it?",
    480: "But it's not enough. I want more distress, more despair.",
    481: "I put so much effort into creating hope in order to feed your despair and make it grow.",
    482: "So, just like Crazy Eddie slashing his prices and passing the savings on to you, let me give you a hint!",
    483: "Okey-dokey! Like they say, seeing is believing!",
    484: "I'd like for you to see the outside world.",
    485: "Now are you interested in what I have to say? You wanna see what's out there?",
    486: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I wanna see too!",
    487: "See your faces sink into despair.",
    488: "Ha ha ha ha ha! Now then, open Sesame!",
    489: "Behold! The world beyond the school walls!",
    490: "This is the outside world you've all been so anxious to claw your way back into.",
    491: "dangerous. The world has grown so very dangerous. That's what this means.",
    492: "What you just saw, all of you should recognize it.",
    493: "That world is locked away within the memories that were taken from you.",
    494: "If you can't remember, please just try. Do your best to try and recall.",
    495: "Ha ha ha ha! Better kick your brain in the ass! Cause it's up to that grey lump whether you live or die!",
    496: "I don't remember. Ain't a fucking excuse no more. Cause now it's time?",
    497: "For the final class trial!",
    498: "Come on, bitches! Remember or die!",
    499: "WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED OUTSIDE?!",
    500: "The video that's playing right now.",
    501: "Oh, um, I'm the mastermind.",
    502: "Uh, nice to meet you too.",
    503: "The world's been destroyed, get it?",
    504: "Okay, okay, that's enough of your little lover's quarrel.",
    505: "Whatever happened, it doesn't matter at this exact point in time, right?",
    506: "The end justifies the means. Everything serves the outcome. In other words,",
    507: "the world has ended. That's the important thing.",
    508: "Calm down, it's okay. There is no need to panic.",
    509: "Every living person will be dead in a hundred years anyway, so the world ending isn't that big a deal.",
    510: "Well, as long as we're being ridiculous, I have another ridiculous story to tell you.",
    511: "It's the story of the Togami Corporation, which has given Byakuya's life all its meaning.",
    512: "I'm glad to see you took the bait.",
    513: "You bit into it like a middle-aged secretary at an all-you-can-eat cake buffet.",
    514: "Hey, hey! So, what do you think happened to the Togami family, hm?",
    515: "Correct! Well done, peasant!",
    516: "I just got so fucking bored waiting, I couldn't help it!",
    517: "Even if you're wrong, eventually you'll figure it out, right? Till then, you're just going in circles.",
    518: "So, no matter what you pick, you get the right answer. Pretty innovative, don't you think?",
    519: "But... do you think it might be a disease? Getting bored so easy, I mean. Do you think I might be... sick?",
    520: "Anyway, like I was saying, Byakuya's entire lineage has been totally annihilated!",
    521: "I can confirm that his entire family has died. Even the distant relatives. The Tagami name has perished.",
    522: "Stop? And said with such authority, a peasant would dare challenge us, the avatar of divine punishment?",
    523: "You must learn your place, peasant. You are no longer the ultimate affluent progeny.",
    524: '"Hell, there IS no world anymore, remember? It got fucked a full year ago!"',
    525: "Huh? I don't make sense?",
    526: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Have you considered the possibility that you're mistaken about that?",
    527: "Well, if I'm understanding you right...",
    528: "It sounds like you think the tragedy happened a year before you arrived here.",
    529: "A few weeks ago...",
    530: "Oh, I get it. You're saying that what happened two years ago actually happened more recently, right?",
    531: "Well, I mean, you guys all started attending Hope's Peak Academy two years ago.",
    532: "I understand why you'd have trouble accepting it, but in the end, you can't deny the truth.",
    533: "And the truth is, everything is cause and effect. Deny that, and you may as well give yourself up to God.",
    534: "So, you must surely understand all the hints I've given you so far, right?",
    535: "What are the memories I took from you?",
    536: "Come now, answer us. Answer with all your heart and soul.",
    537: "Gah! Another correct answer! Well done, peasant!",
    538: "That's right. You've already spent two full years here at Hope's Peak Academy.",
    539: "And that entire period of time is precisely what you've forgotten.",
    540: "Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Everyone's so conflicted!",
    541: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! After seeing all the evidence, do you have any choice but to acknowledge the truth?",
    542: "Isn't it just so desperately dark? The mystery's solved, but it's like a goddamn funeral in here!",
    543: "Shit, man, I've never been to a funeral. Hell yes!",
    544: "Two years of school life, how many moments of blossoming youth have you missed out on?",
    545: "how many fun classes, how many school events. This was your chance to build lasting friendships, right?",
    546: "And on top of that, something tragically sad happened one year ago.",
    547: "The biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history.",
    548: "Right before everyone's eyes, the world came crashing down.",
    549: "You absorbed all that despair, but then you forgot it all.",
    550: "And once you'd forgotten, you made the choice to subject yourselves to this killing game.",
    551: '"Oh, and there\'s one other thing. To be even more precise, the memories you all lost were..."',
    552: "Actually, never mind. I'm bored. Explaining stuff is boring.",
    553: "We are bored of this world.",
    554: "Everyone always talks big, declaring all the great things they'll do, but then they always fizzle out.",
    555: "THIS WORLD IS JUST SO DESPERATELY FUCKING BORING!",
    556: "In a way, I'm jealous of all of you.",
    557: "To give yourself over so completely to such stimulating despair?",
    558: "Yeah, so figure out the rest for yourselves. I'm sick of expositioning all this shit!",
    559: "Figure out where your memories come apart. That's at the heart of all of this.",
    560: "Wow, you still have enough spirit to keep on talking, huh?",
    561: "Um, so I don't know much about the details, but it seems like everyone remembers passing out, right?",
    562: "And your sense of time got all messed up because of the memory loss after that?",
    563: "I guess it must have been something like that.",
    564: "But instead, two whole years had gone by!",
    565: "You got it, honey! Two years of memories? Poof! Gone! Which means, of course...",
    566: "When everyone met for the first time, it wasn't actually for the first time.",
    567: "Unaware of this fact, you took the time to introduce yourselves to each other, but...",
    568: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yep, that's what they reveal!",
    569: "You were all such close friends. You spent two years together. And then you started killing each other.",
    570: "And it was all so you could escape into a world that's already been annihilated!",
    571: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! What a terribly tragic tale! Even if you left now, there's nothing you could do to fix it!",
    572: "I love you all so much.",
    573: "Once your school life here began, I thought about you constantly.",
    574: "it's only natural that I would fall in love.",
    575: "So, since I love you guys so much, I'll tell you all about it!",
    576: "All about the idea we came up with as the ultimate despair! Our plan to bring despair to all mankind!",
    577: "Let's go back in time two years, okay?",
    578: "Back to when everyone first came to this school.",
    579: "School life during that first year overflowed with hope and happiness.",
    580: "Oh boy, it was just the worst!",
    581: "Everyone was enjoying themselves so much. You were all having the time of your lives.",
    582: "But that couldn't last forever, of course. The peacefulness only made it through that first year.",
    583: "Because after that, an event unfolded that hammered a soul-crushing despair into all of humanity.",
    584: "The biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history. The tragedy.",
    585: "All too soon, the world's days of peace came to a bloody end.",
    586: "And as you can imagine, the school was no exception.",
    587: "The tragedy even made its way here, leading to the extermination of most of the students.",
    588: "Hm? What do you mean?",
    589: "You have a point. If I had to describe it, I'd say,",
    590: "it was none of those, how can I put it, it was more of an ideological thing.",
    591: "Despair is contagious, you know? It's almost like a natural phenomenon.",
    592: "Everyone is capable of it.",
    593: "And now the entire world has fallen into despair.",
    594: "In other words, if you see despair as the enemy, then your enemy is the world itself.",
    595: "We didn't ask you to try to understand. This was a tangent anyway, unrelated to the matter at hand.",
    596: "Okay, so let's get back to the story.",
    597: "Hope's peak had taken so much damage. You guys were the only survivors.",
    598: "The members of the 78th Class of Hope's Peak Academy were the only ones left.",
    599: "And then, something super neat happened!",
    600: "Now pay attention, because this is important, and I'm only going to say it once.",
    601: "So guess what? To protect everyone who had survived, Hope's Peak was transformed into a shelter!",
    602: "That's right! It was transformed into a shelter!",
    603: "Ah, I said it twice!",
    604: "Now, someone was responsible for that transformation, for creating what would eventually become your prison.",
    605: "Do any of you know who that might have been?",
    606: "We believe he had something like that in mind, yes.",
    607: "If you, the collective hope of a new generation, could survive, maybe the world could have a fresh start.",
    608: "Yeah, the headmaster put that much faith in you.",
    609: "But creating the shelter was also his single biggest mistake.",
    610: "Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It's laughable, really. He was the headmaster, but he had no idea.",
    611: "He had no idea that we, the ultimate despair, had already made our way into the school.",
    612: "So what was supposed to be a shelter to keep you safe?",
    613: "Became a cage that made it impossible for you to escape despair.",
    614: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I have to say, it really helped me out a lot. It saved me a ton of time!",
    615: "By the way, it was you yourselves who blocked off the windows, the doors, all the exits.",
    616: "Under the headmaster's direction, you all went about your work like obedient little sheep.",
    617: "And then you forgot all about it and started bitching about how you were trapped in here.",
    618: "Once you'd finished building your little shelter, it was time for me and Mukuro to get to work.",
    619: "And thus began the killing game!",
    620: "Me and Mukuro had come here, spending the last two years waiting for that moment.",
    621: "That moment where you all began killing each other served as the climax of our global despair plan!",
    622: "And the only reason you survived the tragedy was so that you could be a part of it.",
    623: "Because this was so much more than a simple high school deathmatch.",
    624: "Rather, it was a method to hunt down and destroy every last remaining speck of hope in the world.",
    625: "Well, it would seem that there's a little bit left out there, a few souls unwilling to give up hope.",
    626: "So I thought I should show them, which is why I-",
    627: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Well, why don't you tell me?",
    628: "Uh-huh. That's exactly what I'm talking about.",
    629: "To show the world the murders taking place at this school, which was meant to be a symbol of hope.",
    630: 'That was the whole point of the Ultimate Despair! When I said "climax", THAT was what I was talking about!',
    631: "The world watched as you fell into despair and began to kill each other one after another.",
    632: "Despair is as contagious as any disease. Any hope left turns to despair.",
    633: "Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Isn't the power of television just amazing?",
    634: "By the way, since we started broadcasting, a whole bunch of people have tried to come and rescue you.",
    635: "but utilizing the heavy weaponry I installed around the school grounds, I had no problem expelling them.",
    636: "I have to thank you all.",
    637: "They were a relentless bunch, refusing to give up on hope and trying to force their beliefs on the world.",
    638: "But in the end, I was able to give them the final despair. Death.",
    639: "Well, sure, but I also gave you a second chance at life, right? So it's like, give and take!",
    640: "And there's a reason I chose you guys to survive when all the other students were dropping like flies!",
    641: "I mean, we built up two years of memories together. You were all my treasured classmates.",
    642: "Sorry, that's a lie. I just figured you'd despair even more when you found out a friend had betrayed you.",
    643: "And that's the truth, which is what you wanted, right? So, does it make you feel utterly lost and hopeless?",
    644: "You solved the mystery, but despair at the truth, right?",
    645: "And if we did, then what?",
    646: "Our final desire for creating this world of despair was so we could experience one last class trial.",
    647: "If you were bold enough to solve the mystery, only to discover that the truth was utterly hopeless...",
    648: "How would you react? What would you do?",
    649: "See, discovering the truth doesn't necessarily lead to a sense of hope.",
    650: "Truth can be full of despair, too. Like right fucking now!",
    651: "Not to mention, all those motives I talked about were totally meaningless.",
    652: "I mean, with the world having ended and all.",
    653: "And think about it. You chose to lock yourselves up here, then started murdering each other to get out.",
    654: "A peasant begging for his life? Oh, how delightful! We've never witnessed such a travesty firsthand.",
    655: "But I'm sorry to say, begging doesn't work on me.",
    656: "All I want is despair, and there's no reason for it.",
    657: "And since there's no reason, there's no argument against it. There's just no understanding it.",
    658: "No argument, no understanding. What better definition of ultimate despair could there be?",
    659: "Huh?",
    660: "Until you see it with your own eyes, truth and falsehood overlap one another.",
    661: "In other words, you're not unlike Schrodinger's cat right now. Is that what you're saying?",
    662: "If so, what then?",
    663: "Are you saying you won't accept the truth until you can go outside and see for yourself?",
    664: "Well, you better not. You go out into that world and you're all gunners for sure.",
    665: "Trust me, I'm not lying about any of this.",
    666: "Huh? Everyone I've killed?",
    667: "What are you talking about? You're the ones who killed them!",
    668: "I didn't kill anyone. I simply gave you a little nudge in the right direction.",
    669: "And that's all it took for you to start killing each other. You're nothing but bloodthirsty animals.",
    670: "That's why anyone was murdered here, peasant.",
    671: "Say what you want about hope, but we're all creatures of instinct, right? Despair comes naturally!",
    672: "Hell yes! That's funny as shit!",
    673: "You certainly have a talent for passing the buck, don't you? That must be your hope, huh?",
    674: "but we don't have much time left to keep up this banter. We have to draw things to a close soon.",
    675: "\"I'm talking about the vote, of course. You didn't forget about that little rule, did you?\"",
    676: "Oh, and also, since this will be the last vote, I decided to change the rules!",
    677: "You guys so full of hope, and me so full of despair.",
    678: "I've decided to have you vote which one will be punished!",
    679: "If even one of you votes to punish Hope, well then...",
    680: "I'll consider that a win for me and punish everyone on the side of hope.",
    681: "Oh, but don't worry. I won't be voting, of course.",
    682: "Oh, let me just mention one more thing when I win to punish you guys.",
    683: "You'll have to stay here till you grow old and die. No fighting, no killing. That's your punishment.",
    684: "If you're not happy with that, then go ahead and punish me, and make your way to the outside world.",
    685: "Enter a world fallen from grace, where only despair exists, where you'd likely be dead within a day.",
    686: "Wait a sec, I just got hit with an inspiration bomb!",
    687: '"Dying of old age is boring as shit, right? The audience at home isn\'t gonna dig that at all!"',
    688: "So, here's what'll happen! One of you will get to experience an instant, super impressive punishment!",
    689: "And I get to decide who's gonna have to suck it down!",
    690: "Makoto, you're up!",
    691: "Yeah, you've been acting up, causing all kinds of trouble. I hate you!",
    692: "So let me make this clear. Everyone has two choices in front of them.",
    693: "If a single person votes for Hope to be punished,",
    694: "Then only Makoto will receive a harsh punishment, and the rest of you will live here in peace.",
    695: "If, on the other hand, you desire to see us punished, then you must all leave this place.",
    696: "I will force you out, ensuring you all die horrible deaths in the outside world.",
    697: "What I'm saying is, if you sacrifice Makoto, the rest of you will get to live out your lives!",
    698: "What? Has your resolve softened? Have you lost confidence? Are you afraid of being punished?",
    699: "Don't you have faith in your friends?",
    700: "It's okay. You're right to be afraid.",
    701: "It would seem all of those around you have realized the futility of going against me.",
    702: "It's so beautiful. Your lovely faces, eroded by despair, have come together as one.",
    703: "Besides, Kyoko, you could never betray your father, could you?",
    704: "I mean, the headmaster's only wish was that all of you would survive, right?",
    705: "That's why he tried to trap you all here after all.",
    706: "The least you can do is try to honor your dead father's wishes.",
    707: "One person's despair is enough to seal your fate. Isn't that just the most hopeless outcome ever?",
    708: "So, who do you think's gonna give in? Whose despair is gonna sign your death warrant?",
    709: "So boring. Stubborn till the very end, huh?",
    710: "Well, that's fine. Then let's just hurry up and get it over with.",
    711: "It's time for the final vote. Everything will come to an end. Your stupid hope.",
    712: "AND YOUR STUPID LIFE!",
    713: "If I were to die,",
    714: "That would be the end of Hope's Peak Academy.",
    715: "By the way, the air outside is totally polluted, you know.",
    716: "The only reason we're okay in here...",
    717: "is thanks to the air purifiers in the Physics Lab.",
    718: "If I die, the purifiers will screech to a halt.",
    719: "In other words, as soon as I die?",
    720: "The communal life you've all been living will come to an end.",
    721: "All of you will have to leave.",
    722: "You'll have to go into the world outside, where only death and despair are waiting.",
    723: "So, what are you gonna do?",
    724: "Will you just die? Is that what you want?",
    725: "W-what the...?",
    726: "What the hell are you?",
    727: "So uncool!",
    728: "Your stupid faces, the stupid things you've said, the stupid way you all treat each other!",
    729: "It's all so uncool! So unhip!",
    730: "SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP",
    731: "Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame!",
    732: "What's going on?",
    733: "WHAT'S HAPPENING?!",
    734: "The hell?",
    735: "I lost?",
    736: "WELL THAT'S JUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-",
    737: "TOTALLY THE BEST!",
    738: "So this is despair...",
    739: "TRUE DESPAIR!",
    740: "And now I...",
    741: "*laughs*",
    742: "Ah! No, no, no!",
    743: "There's one last thing.",
    744: "It's fine, it's fine.",
    745: "*laughs*",
    746: "Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!",
    747: "How many times do I have to tell you?!",
    748: "Don't get in my way!",
    749: "Poo-hoo-hoo! Poo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!",
    750: "So this is how the despair of death feels. It's so wonderful!",
    751: "Even a tenth of this despair, even a hundredth.",
    752: "I want every last soul on this planet to taste such despair!",
    753: "I want the entire world to die with that despair in its mouth!",
    754: "Okay, let's do this.",
    755: "I've reserved an extra special punishment for last.",
    756: "Let's give it everything we've got, it's punishment time!",
    757: "*laughs*",
    758: "You suck.",
    759: "What do you want?",
    760: "So uncool!",
    761: "Hope is a joke.",
    762: "Outside is only despair.",
    763: "Who are you?",
    764: "You're gross.",
    765: "You're scared, aren't you?",
    766: "SUFFER FROM DESPAIR!",
    767: "You dare to stand against us?!",
    768: "Your idiocy ends here.",
    769: "I just love despair!",
    770: "You're unbearable!",
    771: "Would you like to die?",
    772: "Everything is pointless",
    773: "Despair into tomorrow, despair into your memories, despair into nothingness.",
    774: "No!",
    775: "Damn you!",
    776: "Wow, hello there! Is it me you were hoping to see?",
    777: "So you figured it out, huh? Well, whatever. What are you gonna do?",
    778: "I'm the ultimate murderous fiend, Genocide Jack! Or better yet, let's go with Genocide Jill!",
    779: "Not Toko. That's a loser name, and what happened is a textbook split personality.",
    780: "So what if one of them happens to be a serial killer? You should turn a blind eye to one's faults.",
    781: "*Evil Laugh*",
    782: "Like they say, sound and murderous mind, sound and murderous body.",
    783: "Yes, well, the world is composed of a front and a back, you know.",
    784: "Just like how every inning has a top and a bottom, or how in the depths of every truth lives a little lie.",
    785: "Behind every dark and gloomy soul lives another that shines as bright as the sun!",
    786: "*laughs*",
    787: "What's up?",
    788: "Well, I'll tell you! I am the mastermind of all masterminds!",
    789: "Just kidding!",
    790: '"Sure, I\'m a bloodthirsty maniac, but life is pain, right? To live is to hurt other people!"',
    791: '"It\'s a necessary evil if you want to survive. The act of living itself causes pain for everyone."',
    792: "Just kidding again!",
    793: "Interesting. Very, very, very interesting.",
    794: "But sorry, as much as I hate to admit it, I'm not the culprit!",
    795: "Maybe so, maybe so, but nevertheless it's the truth!",
    796: "Sorry, but I didn't kill anyone!",
    797: "Oh, an alibi, huh? Now we're talking.",
    798: "*crying*",
    799: "Uh-oh, you don't know?",
    800: "Well then, human garbage, let me tell you!",
    801: "I murder with passion and conviction!",
    802: "I consider myself a professional, and I have a very particular way of doing things.",
    803: "Imagine you go to a fancy Italian restaurant, they're very picky about the noodles, the sauce, everything!",
    804: "But what happened to Chihiro?",
    805: "It'd be like if that same Italian restaurant started using ragu or Chef Boyardee.",
    806: "THIS IS NO CREATION OF MINE!",
    807: "That's right! In my recipe of murder, if the bloody message is the tortellini...",
    808: "Then the arrangement of the body would be the pesto sauce!",
    809: "And guess what? I used my own specially designed scissors for the murders and the arrangement!",
    810: "Like I said, I'm a professional, so naturally I'm very picky about the tools I use.",
    811: "And, and and and and and and and, you know what else?",
    812: "Big Mac said there's two differences, but he's wrong.",
    813: "Listen up, Big Mac! There's actually one more difference!",
    814: "My word, you really didn't notice? Take a look at who the victims were in each Genocide Jack case!",
    815: "There's a pattern there just waiting to be discovered.",
    816: "Figure that out, and it'll be plain as death why I couldn't have possibly killed that little lolly girl.",
    817: "Bingo! Bullseye right on the money!",
    818: "That's right! The people I kill with such passion and conviction are all adorable little men!",
    819: "I can't believe I said it! I'm so embarrassed!",
    820: "I can't help it! I'm just a full-throttle boy-on-boy fangirl, and the mopey side of me just hates it!",
    821: "But now I'm on the fast track to becoming a full-fledged fan-madam!",
    822: "Would an Italian chef suddenly start making ramen just because they're both noodles? Don't be stupid.",
    823: "I have too much passion and conviction to cross that line. That's the absolute reality of the one and only.",
    824: "Quiet, lowly cur!",
    825: "I would never kill for a reason as petty as mere survival.",
    826: "And if by some fluke I did kill to survive,",
    827: "Why would I bother with the message and arrangement? It'd make me the obvious suspect!",
    828: "Plus, whatever reason I have for killing, I would never leave out my prized scissors.",
    829: "Who would go out of their way to use a big, stupid, heavy dumbbell?",
    830: "ANY SCISSORS?",
    831: "I don't just use any scissors. I only use my own set of high-class, envy-of-the-entire-world scissors!",
    832: "Are you sure about that?",
    833: "Da-da-da-da!",
    834: "That's right! So I can kill anywhere, anytime!",
    835: "Why would I resort to dumbbells or rope when I have my trusty scissors by my side?",
    836: "Go ahead! Tell me I'm wrong! You can't, Ken! You gutter dogs! All of you!",
    837: "Not to mention, I have no clue how to tie a good knot, so rope's totally out of the question anyway!",
    838: "So, he rearranged the scene to disguise it and make it look like I put my stamp on it!",
    839: "The adorable Glasses Man was behind it all! I'm on fire!",
    840: "What? The difference between the cases?",
    841: "You want me to explain it again?",
    842: "When I want to kill, I use my very own special scissors.",
    843: "And I use those same scissors to arrange the body.",
    844: "I don't disagree with not disagreeing!",
    845: "I bet those massive jugs of hers were TOTALLY FAKE!",
    846: "What is this? Some kind of secret girl-on-girl action? Is that what you two are about?",
    847: "Then... he was a cross-dresser? Now I'm really on fire! I wish I had killed him!",
    848: "This is a most titillating situation!",
    849: "What a marvelous friendship!",
    850: "Then the only reason he could have known what color the tracksuit was...",
    851: "is if he saw Cherry with it before he died! That's the only possibility!",
    852: "So, how about it? Did you see the tracksuit or didn't you?",
    853: "Are you a witch? She's a witch! You're positively frightful!",
    854: "Hmm? What do you have there?",
    855: "Shut your murdering mouth, murderer!",
    856: "Now that's a bold assumption!",
    857: "So the killer just crouched down,",
    858: "And carted the body off to the repository!",
    859: "Yeah, it'd be totally impossible! Not that I can say for sure myself.",
    860: "Well, I mean, isn't that just a matter of taking off the suit when you're ready to move the body?",
    861: "What a pain in the ass!",
    862: "That's totally true. We're all in the clear.",
    863: "Well, don't forget, I was passed out in the equipment room the whole time.",
    864: "Besides, I didn't do either of them anyway.",
    865: "Huh? Later on?",
    866: "Oh, oh, oh, I know, I know!",
    867: "Because he was super good at playing dead! Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom!",
    868: "A few tissues is all I need to keep my glasses clean.",
    869: "He figured if he was gonna play dead, he should go all out, so he just dumped it everywhere!",
    870: "but he got crazy with it and had to wipe his glasses off when he was done. God, what an idiot!",
    871: "The door was locked?",
    872: "PANTS!",
    873: "Hello? Over here! Objection! Objection!",
    874: "I don't really understand what's going on, but... Hifumi had that letter, right?",
    875: "So whoever wrote it wasn't drawing out TikTok, they were drawing out Huffy!",
    876: "Oh, yes! Why must you ruin it every time?",
    877: "Huffy had the note, right?",
    878: "Than the person it was intended for!",
    879: "Must have been happy!",
    880: "The time doesn't matter!",
    881: "The note has nothing to do with TikTok.",
    882: "What the hell are you talking about?",
    883: "Hmm, well, when you put it like that...",
    884: "No further objections.",
    885: "Stuff down his pants, no less!",
    886: "Stop trying to steal the spotlight, you stupid walrus!",
    887: "Sounds like a Justice Hammer 5 is about to make its appearance!",
    888: "Check out MurderGear.com slash HammerTime for more info.",
    889: "That's problem numero uno right now!",
    890: "Then the fortune-telling idiot is the culprit after all!",
    891: "Indecent?",
    892: "Haha! Guess who's back!",
    893: "My fault! Master's fault! When our faults combine, they soar to even greater heights!",
    894: "Well, to be honest, Miss Morose and me don't actually share our memories.",
    895: "So I can't really say what was going on.",
    896: "But I was just minding my own business, sleeping peacefully, when someone shook me awake!",
    897: "Was it a prince paying me a visit? I wondered, so I opened my eyes to see.",
    898: "Splatter everywhere! I was not prepared for that!",
    899: "And, well, I guess it took me by surprise.",
    900: "I got so startled, I smacked her with the first thing I could find, which I guess was a bottle.",
    901: "No, she's terrible! Thanks to her, I murdered someone who wasn't an adorable boy for the first time ever!",
    902: "I wasn't about to die for some woman! If I'm gonna go down, I want it to be for killing Master!",
    903: "But I just can't catch a break, you know? Fate's got it out for me.",
    904: "Cuz normally, Sakura should have been able to dodge my attack no problem!",
    905: "Your wish is my command, darling!",
    906: "I was just sleeping peacefully.",
    907: "And all of a sudden, Sakura was right there in front of me!",
    908: "I remember waking up right in front of the magazine shelf.",
    909: "You got it, Ice Master! Good!",
    910: "Right where I woke up!",
    911: "I killed her there in front of the shelf.",
    912: "Hey, come on now, look at me! I can't carry anything heavier than my own scissors!",
    913: "There's no way I could move a muscle-bound heavyweight like that!",
    914: "I don't know! What's this whole locked room thing about anyway?",
    915: "I think the fact that I don't know proves I didn't kill her, thank you very much.",
    916: "So you're dead set on blaming me, huh?",
    917: '"You even checked in there? God, you really ARE into dead bodies!"',
    918: "Hahahaha! You're making me go all weak in the knees!",
    919: "Everyone, quiet! Shut up and listen to Master!",
    920: "And that's where the poison came from? Section C?",
    921: "Huh!? Master!?",
    922: "Oh, no! Master's in real trouble!",
    923: "You have to drink some water! You can't just swallow powder! It'll stick to your throat!",
    924: "What's wrong with you, Big Mac? You're being awfully pushy!",
    925: "What's so strange about that?",
    926: "Same here.",
    927: "Huh? So Sakura, who was apparently murdered, just poisoned herself?",
    928: "And it was only on our instep, right?",
    929: "I don't believe it! I don't believe it any more than I believe I can fly!",
    930: "Da-da-da-da! It's me, your friendly neighborhood serial killer!",
    931: "Huh? What video?",
    932: "WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!",
    933: "Oh, nice to meet ya!",
    934: "Aye, aye! Roger, you got it, Captain!",
    935: "I don't have all the details, but...",
    936: "Of course it does!",
    937: "Of course I do!",
    938: "I only answer questions when someone bothers to ask me. I'm the quiet type, you know?",
    939: "Huh? What's the matter, Master? Do you really not remember the tragedy?",
    940: "Oh no! You seriously forgot? Maybe I can help you remember! With a kiss...",
    941: "Well, I can't really say if it happened or if it's still happening.",
    942: "But it was the biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history.",
    943: "Because it's all because of that event!",
    944: "Are you serious? I'm talking about the way the world is now!",
    945: "Copy that, darling!",
    946: "Okay, so this big, awful, tragic event, they started just calling it the tragedy, happened about a year ago.",
    947: "It was so big and so bad that even this murderous fiend went pale at the sight of it.",
    948: "I guess you could say what happened was man-made.",
    949: "But it was more on the level of a world-wide natural disaster!",
    950: "Either way, there's no doubt that it was the biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history!",
    951: "And as a result, in basically no time flat!",
    952: "The world turned out the way it did, and that's that.",
    953: "Well, it just so happens I don't know any of the specifics!",
    954: "Miss Morose saw it all play out in real time, so why don't you ask her?",
    955: "I couldn't live up to Master's expectations! To die! To die! This is the true tragedy!",
    956: "Wooza wooza! Is something wrong?",
    957: "Hmm, and whose pocketbook is that?",
    958: "No, even I can't laugh at that.",
    959: "She's saying she'll let us live!",
    960: "*laughs*",
    961: "I don't care either way. I'm fine with whichever one is more interesting.",
    962: "Actually, I may not look like it, but I always hated school.",
    963: "Hell, no matter how I look, still hate it!",
    964: "Oh, but no matter what, Master has to come along with us!",
    965: "Meh.",
    966: "I can keep on living as long as I have my master's love!",
    967: "*laughs*",
    968: "Thank you.",
    969: "Got it?",
    970: "Thank you.",
