    1: "and the murder took place in Makoto's room.",
    2: "That much should have been obvious after taking one look at the scene. It shouldn't even need explaining.",
    3: "You don't think so?",
    4: "Speaking of which, I'd like to ask the bear. If there is an accomplice, do they also become blackened?",
    5: "Why didn't you say so in the first place?",
    6: "So you're saying the knife she took was then taken from her and she was killed with it?",
    7: "In that case, you may not have taken the knife, but you still could have killed her.",
    8: "Regardless, it was a pointless act. Wasting time trying to break down a door that wasn't locked is...",
    9: "That is a definite possibility.",
    10: "Then either it was Makoto who lived there, or Sayaka who switched rooms for a single night.",
    11: "So what you're saying is, the room Sayaka was staying in, was actually marked as her room.",
    12: "The person with the knife attacked first, and the sword was used as an impromptu defense.",
    13: "No, far from it. It's almost as if she'd been planning to commit a murder of her own.",
    14: "She took the knife from the kitchen, then invited the culprit to the room she was staying in.",
    15: "And if it's true that she had the kitchen knife and attacked without provocation,",
    16: "I don't know. I'm not sure our soft-hearted Makoto is capable of that kind of cutthroat behavior.",
    17: "I'm sure Sayaka realized the same thing, which is why out of all of us, she asked him to switch rooms.",
    18: "And if you say you used it for something else, you'll have to explain exactly when, where, and why.",
    19: "So, you have no rebuttal?",

    1: "If you don't mind, I will proceed from here. Let's move on to discussion of the culprit.",
    2: "Although, I believe the criminal behind this heinous act is already quite clear.",
    3: "Chihiro's killer is",
    4: "The fiendish serial killer, Genocide Jack.",
    5: "The culprit is Genocide Jack. I'm sure of it.",
    6: "Case closed, as far as I'm concerned.",
    7: "Why? What makes it impossible?",
    8: "The why of it is probably more trouble than it's worth, so let's forget about that for now.",
    9: "More importantly, it outlines all the specifics of every Genocide Jack case in exceeding detail.",
    10: "According to the file, there appear to be two defining characteristics in every Genocide Jack case.",
    11: "The first is that a bloody message is found written at the scene of every murder.",
    12: "But more important is the other characteristic, and it's something that has never been made public.",
    13: "Why don't you tell them, Makoto?",
    14: "However, Chihiro was most definitely suspended in the same way.",
    15: "So how did the culprit know about this when only high-level police officials were aware of it?",
    16: "There's only one logical answer I can think of.",
    17: "It's because the culprit in this case is the real Genocide Jack.",
    18: "Yes, in fact, it's Toko.",
    19: "Genocide Jack's true identity is Toko Fukawa.",
    20: "Is Toko Genocide Jack? The answer is yes and no.",
    21: "Perfectly acceptable.",
    22: "Toko's strange behavior after seeing the body is proof enough that she has a split personality.",
    23: "That's right. Think back. She fainted when she saw Chihiro's corpse, and then, when she woke up,",
    24: "Not to mention, once she regained consciousness and saw Chihiro's body again, she was utterly calm.",
    25: "In other words, within her is one personality that can handle blood, and one that obviously can.",
    26: "The reason she locked herself in her room wasn't to keep other people from getting in.",
    27: "It was to keep her other personality from getting out.",
    28: "Toko was afraid, afraid of the murderous fiend inside of her, of killing even more people.",
    29: "I do believe you misunderstood her.",
    30: "What she's trying to say isn't, how can you know all this?",
    31: "No. What she wants to know is, how could you tell them?",
    32: "Last night, just before Monokuma gave his motive speech, Toko and I had a strange conversation.",
    33: "She told me a most interesting story.",
    34: "She said a murderous fiend lived within her, and she was afraid it could appear and attack at any time.",
    35: "And that trepidation is what's caused her to have such a bleak attitude. Isn't that right, Toko?",
    36: "You have only yourself to blame. You came to me with your tragic little story. I didn't ask you to.",
    37: "This is the real world, not some romantic fantasy fairy tale.",
    38: "Besides, you broke your promise first.",
    39: "You said that as long as you were here, no matter what, you wouldn't let Genocide Jack kill anyone.",
    40: "But in spite of that promise,",
    41: "How many times do I have to tell you? I never said that.",
    42: "But you weren't able to do it. You just couldn't resist that rush you got from killing, could you?",
    43: "but your efforts were useless. What a disappointment.",
    44: "Well, the opening act is nearly finished. All that's left is to hear from the person in question directly.",
    45: "This should be enough to convince you. This murderous fiend is responsible for Chihiro's death.",
    46: "There's clearly a motive, so there should be no doubt.",
    47: "Remember what Monokuma told us?",
    48: "If someone didn't murder and graduate within 24 hours, an embarrassing memory or secret would be revealed.",
    49: "Well, let's assume that Toko's secret was about Genocide Jack.",
    50: "If a secret like that came to light, Toko's life would have undoubtedly been forever ruined.",
    51: "So she had a very clear motive to never have that side of herself exposed.",
    52: "When you compare your past murders to this incident,",
    53: "The modus operandi matches completely.",
    54: "What more proof do we need?",
    55: "Give it up. You killed her.",
    56: "We get it. You've clearly explained your hobby and your philosophy. But that's not all there is to it.",
    57: "It's a different matter entirely, when you're forced to kill in order to survive.",
    58: "Lowly. Kurt.",
    59: "I see. So now the suspicion falls on me.",
    60: "then I must ask, when would you say I began acting suspicious? Surely you must have an answer.",
    61: "I should have naturally thought of the boys' locker room first. Is that what you want to say?",
    62: "The victim was Chihiro, a girl, hence why I said we should check the girl's locker room.",
    63: "Okay, then. What's so strange about it?",
    64: "Go ahead, share with the rest of the class.",
    65: "The victim was Chihiro, who was a girl.",
    66: "So of course I would suggest we check the girls' locker room first.",
    67: "There was no time for pointless distractions.",
    68: "What's so strange about that?",
    69: "I see. That's a good answer, I must admit.",
    70: "Interesting. Very interesting indeed. But your reasoning is still too weak.",
    71: "What's wrong? Is that it? Surely you've got more than that. Go ahead, show us.",
    72: "What's the matter? You're not finished already, are you? There must be more to it.",
    73: "Oh, proof that I'm the culprit, you mean.",
    74: "I'd never seen that rope before in my life.",
    75: "Obviously, somebody else must have had it hidden away somewhere.",
    76: "That's really what you think? Then your conclusion is something like this?",
    77: "I killed Chihiro in the girl's locker room, then hung her up and wrote that bloody message.",
    78: "I intentionally made it look like Genocide Jack was behind it.",
    79: "Is that about right?",
    80: "What's wrong? I asked you if you think that's what happened.",
    81: "Is that right? And what, pray tell, is still bothering you?",
    82: "I killed her in the girl's locker room, then disguised my crime.",
    83: "Specifically, I dressed it up to make it look like it was the work of a homicidal psychopath.",
    84: "What about all that bothers you?",
    85: "How disappointing.",
    86: "What kind of question is that? Even in the world of disappointments, this is a true letdown.",
    87: "She was found dead in the girls' locker room. There is absolutely no question about that.",
    88: "How could the scene of the crime have been anywhere else?",
    89: "The rest of the murder scene?",
    90: "That was awfully specific. Please tell me you have a reason for saying all of that.",
    91: "Come on, Makoto.",
    92: "If there's any chance the murder took place somewhere else, let's see the proof.",
    93: "Your proof is some posters?",
    94: "Actually, the rule states that loaning your handbook is prohibited. It says nothing about borrowing one.",
    95: "In other words, you could borrow a dead person's handbook all you want, and you'd be safe.",
    96: "Of course, if it were broken, that wouldn't make any sense anyway.",
    97: "Assuming his handbook did, in fact, list his gender as male, then yes, that would be true.",
    98: "Well, I must admit, I did find it rather odd.",
    99: "I knew he felt a little... off. There was a certain incongruity to his female body.",
    100: "So now everything has been connected. All the mysteries have finally become clear.",
    101: "Very interesting. This has become very interesting indeed.",
    102: "So that's your thinking, huh? Well, it bothers me that you don't have more concrete reasons, but",
    103: "It's fine. I guess I'll mark it as correct for the time being.",
    104: "He's right. I am not the culprit.",
    105: "I just happened to come across the corpse in the girls' locker room and decided to alter it.",
    106: "No, I am not effing with you right now. I'm telling you the truth.",
    107: "Go ahead, find it very hard to believe. You're free to be executed along with the rest of us.",
    108: "My reasons hardly matter right now. Uncovering the culprit is much more important, wouldn't you say?",
    109: "Now then, if it wasn't me, who was it?",
    110: "Excellent. Then shall we resume our game of hide-and-seek?",
    111: "As was noted, the evidence is already gone. There's nothing to get fingerprints from.",
    112: "What do you mean the specific tracksuit?",
    113: "Hey, Celeste, what color was Chihiro's tracksuit?",
    114: "Perhaps. But you handed him the shovel, didn't you? That's why you said what you did.",
    115: "Focus on the tracksuit and it'll be obvious who he met with? What a bunch of nonsense.",
    116: "That's odd. I didn't think the handbooks were quite so fragile.",
    117: "I won't say it's not possible, but who would have done something like that?",
    118: "I don't know of anyone who took their handbook into the sauna.",

    1: "And he's not the only one. I think Hiro is innocent as well.",
    2: "the suspicious individual hidden within the suit.",
    3: "Go ahead, Makoto. Tell them who it was.",
    4: "Then there can be no doubt. Hiro is the prime suspect.",
    5: "It makes perfect sense. Hiro was the suspicious individual in the suit, but he's not the culprit.",
    6: "That's right. The culprit in this case has nothing to do with being in the robo-justice suit.",
    7: "Of course. But before we get to that,",
    8: "There's something else we need to clarify first, so let's get that out of the way.",
    9: "All things have a proper order.",
    10: "we must clarify the method of transportation for Taka's lifeless body.",
    11: "It would seem that his corpse was moved using certain particular items.",
    12: "Makoto, can you tell us what they were?",
    13: "*tsch*",
    14: "She's raised an objection. How do you respond?",
    15: "Well, anyway, that was just something we had to get out of the way. Let's get back to the main subject.",
    16: "I'd be happy to explain why the occupant of the suit couldn't possibly be the killer.",
    17: "If you look back on how the body was transported, it will become immediately obvious.",
    18: "As we know, Taka was killed in the equipment room.",
    19: "And from there, the body was moved to the repository, correct?",
    20: "Now, keep in mind that the dolly doesn't have a handle.",
    21: "If you accept everything we just said,",
    22: "then you must realize that whoever was in the suit couldn't possibly be the culprit.",
    23: "On top of that, if you were wearing such a rigid, cumbersome suit,",
    24: "it's very unlikely you would have the dexterity to go about wrapping the body in a tarp.",
    25: "Celeste informed us that she'd found the bodies, and we all headed to the repository.",
    26: "which is where we rediscovered the corpses.",
    27: "It's true that Hifumi was killed with Justice Hammer 3.",
    28: "while Taka's death came from a swing of Justice Hammer 4.",
    29: "So you're saying the culprit wanted us to think the hammers were used in order...",
    30: "But in reality, Taka was killed before Hifumi?",
    31: "Okay then, let's see the proof.",
    32: "That's exactly why the culprit wrote the numbers on each hammer and had them increase in size.",
    33: "That way, when we saw how they were used in each incident, we'd easily make that wrong assumption.",
    34: "Even if she could pull that off, there's no way she could have done the same with Hifumi's body.",
    35: "Because, as we just established, she was passed out in the equipment room when his body disappeared.",
    36: "I don't think it has anything to do with the occult. I think what she's implying is...",
    37: "We thought Hifumi was dead, but perhaps in reality he was still alive.",
    38: "Perhaps he was simply playing dead.",
    39: "That's right, it wasn't long after finding his body that we heard the announcement.",
    40: "First of all, if two bodies had been found, there really should have been two announcements.",
    41: "What do you say, Monokuma? Any comment?",
    42: "No, actually, that was plenty.",
    43: "He said it's only broadcast when a body is discovered for the first time, which means...",
    44: "Even if we find the same body again later, he won't make the announcement again.",
    45: "If that's true, then why was the announcement made again later on?",
    46: "Exactly. If we were actually rediscovering both bodies, the announcement shouldn't have played.",
    47: "And the next time we saw his body...",
    48: "It was in the repository.",
    49: "I wouldn't be caught dead using a tacky piece of garbage like that.",
    50: "While we were all gathered in the nurse's office, he went to the equipment room and took Taka's body.",
    51: "And it could only have been Hifumi, who'd just finished stashing Taka's body there.",
    52: "Where's your proof? Go ahead, show us.",
    53: "That means Hifumi knew the note was important.",
    54: "During that time, we'd all split up and were searching for Taka's missing body.",
    55: "In other words, during that time, none of us have alibis.",
    56: "I'm surprised. It seems there's some semblance of a brain knocking around that skull of yours after all.",
    57: "Is it not possible they used a different weapon?",
    58: "So, Hifumi moved Taka's body to the repository, where someone then used a hammer to kill him.",
    59: "You're saying that two people could act as each other's accomplices to commit two separate murders.",
    60: "The mastermind picked their target and managed to convince him to go along with their plan.",
    61: "And then to avoid the no accomplices rule, they simply killed their accomplice.",
    62: "Which, if true, means that betraying Hifumi was part of the plan from the very beginning.",
    63: "you think so? I can't help but admire its cunning. Still, their choice of accomplice seems odd.",
    64: "A joke? I wonder.",
    65: "Just to be clear, there is evidence to support it.",
    66: "It is. Throughout the investigation, there was certain behavior that was common only to the two of you.",
    67: "Considering what we've learned so far, it only further proves that the two of you were working together.",
    68: "Shush, the adults are talking now.",
    69: "As he said, only Celeste and Hifumi ever laid eyes on the costumed individual.",
    70: "If we accept that Hifumi was one of the culprits, we can't help but suspect what Celeste has said as well.",
    71: "After taking Hifumi to the nurse's office, we all began our search for this individual, correct?",
    72: "And not too long after that, do you remember what Celeste said?",
    73: "We headed to the second floor specifically because of what she claimed to have seen.",
    74: "Next, to draw us all to the physics lab up on the third floor,",
    75: "And when we'd all come to see what was wrong, what was it she said?",
    76: "Once she'd done her job of getting us all up to the physics lab,",
    77: "It was time for her partner to get to work.",
    78: "In fact, Celeste was precisely the one who proposed that we split up.",
    79: "Well, if Celeste and Hifumi were working together, all those chance events suddenly become connected.",
    80: "And on top of that, that piercing cry of yours early on.",
    81: "That was to signal he foo me, wasn't it?",
    82: "It was your way of telling him, we are on the third floor, everything's going according to plan.",
    83: "Why else would you let out a scream that could have carried across the sea?",
    84: "Each piece isn't much by itself, but start putting them together and the picture gets very ugly indeed.",
    85: "Wouldn't you agree, Celeste?",
    86: "Don't bother trying to deny it.",
    87: "You made one fatal mistake.",
    88: "I didn't even catch it myself when you first said it, but-",
    89: "Looking back, I can say that that one little slip-up was your undoing.",
    90: "I'm talking about what you said after Hifumi's body disappeared and we returned to the nurse's office.",
    91: "Then pay attention. Sakura, Toko, and I were first to discover Taka's body in the equipment room.",
    92: "Then Makoto showed up and told us Hifumi had been killed, so Sakura and I left with Makoto.",
    93: "Once we were in the hall, we ran into Celeste and the four of us headed to the nurse's office.",
    94: "Now, the entire time we were together, none of us said anything about Taka being dead.",
    95: "Think about it. Celeste's comment doesn't make sense. It was completely out of place.",
    96: "You hear that, Celeste? Everyone's having some trouble understanding. Could you repeat what you said?",
    97: "If you're really not the culprit, you shouldn't have any problem repeating it, right?",
    98: "And that's all it takes to finish this. It's obvious, isn't it?",
    99: "What was so strange about Celeste's comment?",
    100: "Exactly. And we didn't run into her until after we were all out in the hall.",
    101: "so there was never any chance for her to have seen his body in the equipment room for herself.",
    102: "Imaginations.",
    103: "Well then, I suppose this is checkmate.",
    104: "Don't talk.",
    105: "How long do you plan to go on pretending?",
    106: "So, you've finally accepted it.",
    107: "Interesting.",

  [Chapter.Chapter_4]: {
    metadata: { index: 1609 },
    1: "Hmph. Idiot.",
    2: "And what reason do you have for saying so?",
    3: "Is that it? That doesn't make any sense.",
    4: "I don't deny that she wanted to meet with us, but",
    5: "I never went to see her.",
    6: "You just did exactly as the note asked? What a fool.",
    7: "Assuming he's telling the truth, someone else must have put the magazine back on the shelf.",
    8: "In other words, at least one other person was in the rec room both before and after the incident.",
    9: "And remember, this girl examines dead bodies as a hobby. Personally, I'm inclined to believe her.",
    10: "King, Rook, Bishop, Pawn, I definitely remember seeing each of those.",
    11: "Okay, fine. Let's hear it.",
    12: "And you just now decided to share that with us?",
    13: "Could someone tighten the screws on his brain? I think they've come loose.",
    14: "Stop wasting my time. Just tell us the truth.",
    15: "Out with it.",
    16: "Talk. Now.",
    17: "imbeciles, all of you.",
    18: "Just answer the question, did you kill Sakura?",
    19: "Just go away and die your meaningless death alone. Don't drag me into it.",
    20: "No. Not quite yet.",
    21: "Don't you think there was something odd about Toko's story? I mean, you had to have noticed.",
    22: "Hiro's attack, and then Toko's, but that still wasn't the end of it.",
    23: "Tell us your story one more time. Tell us what happened after you fainted.",
    24: "Then even this gaggle of idiots should understand what I'm talking about.",
    25: "And where did the attack take place?",
    26: "So, you finally noticed.",
    27: "No, I'm sure she's telling the truth. Anyone who saw the murder scene should think the same way.",
    28: "Well, are you still convinced the case has come to an end?",
    29: "No, she's not. I've been saying all along, there's still more to this case.",
    30: "and",
    31: "That's because you're overlooking vital information.",
    32: "Some sort of reaction within her body. Most likely...",
    33: "Sakura was poisoned.",
    34: "That's right. This is the conclusion I've arrived at, and so there can be no mistake.",
    35: "Is it really so hard to believe? Then let me explain exactly how the culprit was able to poison her.",
    36: "Of course, if you don't mind.",
    37: "The key to unlocking this mystery was hiding in the chem lab up on the fourth floor.",
    38: "You never would have, since you gave up on the search the moment you were barred from the crime scene.",
    39: "There is a big shelving unit in the chem lab that houses a variety of mixtures and chemicals.",
    40: "And that's where I found this.",
    41: "It's not an especially powerful poison, but it'll still kill you if you drink an entire bottle.",
    42: "but the specific properties don't matter. What does matter is where I found it.",
    43: "The shelf is divided up into three sections, A, B, and C.",
    44: "In Section A, dietary supplements, in B, reagents, and in C, a variety of lethal chemicals.",
    45: "Well, that's the question, isn't it?",
    46: "Strange, isn't it? Why would there be a bottle of poison mixed in with all those nutritional additives?",
    47: "Because the culprits switched it out, that's why.",
    48: "I mean, this.",
    49: "Ugh, that tastes awful.",
    50: "The flavor certainly makes me want to spit it out. What's so high quality about this stuff?",
    51: "I'm talking about the protein, of course.",
    52: "Uh, sure. Do whatever you like.",
    53: "Correct. That wasn't poison in the bottle, but harmless protein powder.",
    54: "Which makes one wonder,",
    55: "The poison that should have been in that bottle, where did it go?",
    56: "Absolutely. The contents of each container were switched.",
    57: "So the protein was in the bottle of poison, and the poison was in the protein can.",
    58: "Once you accept that, it becomes obvious how the culprit was able to get Sakura to drink the poison.",
    59: "All they had to do was hand her something there at the scene, and she was happy to drink the poison herself.",
    60: "a protein drink which actually contained a deadly poison.",
    61: "That's all it took to kill Sakura. That is the true cause of death.",
    62: "but what was offered to her instead was a bottle full of poison.",
    63: "And I already know exactly who swapped the mixtures.",
    64: "Evidence revealing who replaced the two materials was left in the chem lab for anyone to see.",
    65: "I visited the chem lab this morning, and there were definitely no footprints there at that point.",
    66: "They must have appeared around the time of the murder, which leaves no doubt that they're connected.",
    67: "What's more, the footprints were in front of Section A, where I found the bottle meant for the poison.",
    68: "The culprit must have gone to Section A to swap the poison and protein, leaving their footprints behind.",
    69: "And given how clear the prints were, figuring out who they belonged to will pose no problem.",
    70: "All we have to do is check everyone's footprints right now. Then we'll see who-",
    71: "Just as I suspected.",
    72: "The footprints were made by a pair of sneakers. There was no mistaking it.",
    73: "And the only people here who wear sneakers are...",
    74: "These footprints must be...",
    75: "Makoto, are they yours?",
    76: "Okay, then show me your shoe and let me confirm the size of your feet.",
    77: "If the footprints didn't belong to Makoto, that left only one other possibility.",
    78: "Plus, Hina's been acting strange ever since the trial began.",
    79: "You were in an awful rush to get to the vote, weren't you?",
    80: "This whole time, you've been focused on pinning the crime on someone else, haven't you?",
    81: "What about it can't you believe?",
    82: "That's likely exactly why it turned out this way.",
    83: "Because they were so close, Sakura didn't think twice about it when Hina handed her the concoction.",
    84: "Hina used that trust to kill her.",
    85: "She deceived the victim, and she tried to deceive all of us.",
    86: "I have to say, Hina, coming from you, this was a particularly nasty little scheme.",
    87: "Now's my chance to kill her. That's what you thought, right?",
    88: "That's when you switched out the protein powder, and that's when you gave her the poisoned mixture.",
    89: "You're not about to claim she wouldn't kill a close friend, are you?",
    90: "You still don't get it, do you? The game we're playing here isn't so kind.",
    91: "Honeyed words like friendship don't matter here. What matters is outwitting the opponent. Defeating them.",
    92: "not a person alive would sacrifice themselves for another. In the end, we're all in it for ourselves.",
    93: "Just like how this girl sacrificed Sakura to save herself.",
    94: "How many times do you plan to repeat yourself?",
    95: "Surely you're not... Do you honestly think Hina didn't actually kill her?",
    96: "Impossible. She switched out the mixtures. She's the culprit. There's no way you can doubt this.",
    97: "What doesn't fit?",
    98: "Waste your time if you like. It's clear that Hina is the culprit.",
    99: "There's nobody else to suspect. Nobody else could have possibly done it.",
    100: "It's the same thing no matter how many times you hear it. How long until you're satisfied?",
    101: "Honestly, that's enough. How much longer must we tolerate this?",
    102: "What the? Hina, what's the meaning of this?",
    103: "Wha- what the-",
    104: "What the hell?! What's going on here?!",
    105: "What?",
    106: "New evidence? Impossible, there can't be.",
    107: "I... did?",
    108: "Just say it already! What is it you think you've found?",
    109: "But, but, what is it?",
    110: "Fine. If you really do know, explain the meaning of that shard of glass.",
    111: "The window?",
    112: "Wait, hold on. You're moving too fast.",
    113: "I'll grant you, the bottle of poison may well have been in the rec room when it was locked.",
    114: "But how can you say the protein can was put there after the room was unlocked?",
    115: "We already know she was given the protein can with the poison inside, right?",
    116: "If that can wasn't there when she died, how did she get poisoned?",
    117: "What are you talking about? Is this some kind of loaded question?",
    118: "Well, no, not that I remember.",
    119: "Oh, come on! How can you say that?!",
    120: "How can you know what I don't know?",
    121: "No. No, that's impossible!",
    122: "It had to have been in there the whole time!",
    123: "It had to be! It was in there BEFORE the rec room was unlocked!",
    124: "Of course. It came from the window you broke to get in. What about it?",
    125: "W-What?!",
    126: "Kuh.",
    127: "I... I see. So that's your explanation.",
    128: "Kyoko, earlier when you asked if anyone had moved the can or tripped over it,",
    129: "If that's all true, then why did Sakura drink the poison?",
    130: "I thought we all agreed she was tricked into drinking it because of the protein can.",
    131: "You're saying she drank it, knowing what it was?",
    132: "Such a ridiculous fiction is",
    133: "Then tell us already!",
    134: "Er, sorry. Please, tell us.",
    135: "What?",
    136: "The killer was... Sakura?",
    137: "So you're saying Hina consciously deceived us to make it look like she killed Sakura?",
    138: "That's what happened?",
    139: "But, Makoto, how did you...",
    140: "How did you manage to-",
    141: "How were you able to uncover the truth that even I couldn't discern?",
    142: "Yeah.",

    1: "Well, then, let's discuss the specifics of the victim.",
    2: "First, we need to clarify who exactly the unidentified victim is.",
    3: "There's a limit to how much ridiculousness I can tolerate.",
    4: "In that case, I think it would be helpful if someone explained why she actually wears those gloves.",
    5: "In fact, Monokuma told me, apparently you have scars on your hands you don't want anyone to see.",
    6: "This entire discussion is idiotic.",
    7: "Well, Kyoko, any thoughts?",
    8: "Which should have been obvious since she's standing right here.",
    9: "That's the first thing I said. You're the one who's been dragging us around in circles.",
    10: "No, that's not it. The identity of the victim is hidden within that tattoo.",
    11: "To show that they're a member of the team, each soldier that joins the squad",
    12: "would get a tattoo representing Fenrir somewhere on their body",
    13: "No. It means we were wrong in thinking that Mukuro was the mastermind at all.",
    14: "Maybe we shouldn't have been thinking of her as the ultimate despair in the first place.",
    15: "After all, looking at her profile, I didn't see anything that would fit such a description.",
    16: "All it said was that she was the ultimate soldier.",
    17: "If I remember correctly, that other information came from...",
    18: "Kyoko, that's what you told Makoto, right?",
    19: "So you're saying she wasn't an important character?",
    20: "which would mean she was the same as us, just another participant.",
    21: "But how can we trust that? We already know your information about Mukuro was wrong.",
    22: "Fine. Uncovering the identity of the mastermind will have to wait. But remember this.",
    23: "No matter what happens, we will find out who you really are. I stake my family name on it.",
    24: "What you're saying is that both the victim and the culprit are part of the student body?",
    25: "Get a hold of yourself. We've already narrowed down the list of possible suspects.",
    26: "I'm sure you realize who I'm talking about, right, Makoto? Who the evidence points to?",
    27: "Allow me to explain.",
    28: "Just after nighttime last night, I went to the garden, so I can confirm.",
    29: "that at that point, there was no dead body there.",
    30: "So, the murder must have taken place after I left the garden.",
    31: "However, Hiro, Toko, Hina, and I were in the gym the entire time,",
    32: "That's right. The four of us were there trying to dismantle Monokuma.",
    33: "The whole time we were very careful not to go anywhere alone. We even went to the bathroom in pairs.",
    34: "All of which is to say, the four of us all have alibis. The only ones without alibis...",
    35: "Exactly so.",
    36: "Are you thinking of raising an objection?",
    37: "Whatever you want, somebody go ahead and help him out.",
    38: "We've established a timeframe for the murder.",
    39: "It took place somewhere between 10 o'clock at night",
    40: "and 9 o'clock in the morning.",
    41: "That's more than enough time to commit murder, I should think.",
    42: "So Makoto, if you have any objections, now would be the time.",
    43: "And what makes you say that?",
    44: "In which case, the only one left without an alibi is Kyoko.",
    45: "So are you saying you're not the culprit?",
    46: "Shut up, you!",
    47: "Anyway, Kyoko, you actually did have a reason to kill her.",
    48: "She thought Mukuro was the ultimate despair, in other words, the mastermind behind everything.",
    49: "So she killed her to try and put a stop to all this. Isn't that right, Kyoko?",
    50: "But you made one catastrophic mistake. Mukuro wasn't the mastermind at all.",
    51: "And as a result, we were forced into another trial, something I'm sure you weren't at all expecting.",
    52: "Interesting. I'm listening.",
    53: "But why would they go to all that effort just to keep the body from getting wet?",
    54: "If they had, they would have washed both sides. Just washing the one side wouldn't hide anything.",
    55: "Perhaps, but even so, there's one thing that still doesn't make sense.",
    56: "You said the culprit used the tarp to avoid the water and then covered the body in blood, right?",
    57: "But if that's the case, then the blood should have soaked into the ground around the body.",
    58: "But that's not what we saw. Only the victim's clothing had blood on it.",
    59: "The ground was completely clean.",
    60: "If that's actually what took place, it certainly becomes possible that the murder happened earlier.",
    61: "I must admit, Kyoko's reasoning is sound. Makoto's alibi is inadequate.",
    62: "Well then, it looks like we're back to square one.",
    63: "Makoto's alibi is no good, so once again, our suspects are him and Kyoko.",
    64: "Well, don't just stand there. Out with it!",
    65: "You don't seem surprised. You must have noticed earlier.",
    66: "Then why did you hide that fact?",
    67: "So they wanted us to notice the stab wound and then detonated the body afterward.",
    68: "They meant for us to latch onto the knife as the cause of death, then destroy any evidence proving otherwise.",
    69: "If you bothered to put that lump of gray matter between your ears to use, you'd know the answer.",
    70: "Go ahead, Makoto. Tell her or we won't make any headway on this.",
    71: "Anyway, the culprit's motive is becoming more and more obvious by the minute.",
    72: "They wanted the knife wound to look like the fatal injury so that we'd suspect Makoto.",
    73: "And the only one who would benefit from that...",
    74: "is the only other possible suspect. You, Kyoko.",
    75: "What's the problem?",
    76: "Fine. I have no problem with that. Let us continue the debate.",
    77: "It won't change the facts of the case regardless.",
    78: "Then shall we continue the debate?",
    79: "The victim's fatal injury has yet to be determined, correct?",
    80: "And more than that,",
    81: "The victim had suffered countless wounds across her entire body.",
    82: "Okay, then we're safe in assuming the blow to the back of her head is what killed her.",
    83: "We want to figure out what killed her, right? It just so happens we already know.",
    84: "Go ahead and tell them, Makoto. Surely you've deduced the real murder weapon?",
    85: "Indeed, there's no doubt about it.",
    86: "The Titanium Arrow.",
    87: "It was in the dojo locker, right?",
    88: "I have no doubt that was the murder weapon.",
    89: "Anyway, that explains the murder weapon.",
    90: "As for who the culprit is that stashed the weapon in the dojo locker,",
    91: "It was you, Kyoko.",
    92: "Oh no, you absolutely have.",
    93: "Because we have proof, of course. Don't we, Makoto?",
    94: "Hmm? What's the matter?",
    95: "Surely you don't intend to protect a murderer.",
    96: "You know what will happen if you do, don't you?",
    97: "If you cover for the culprit, there's only one thing that can lead to.",
    98: "The death of us all, remember?",
    99: "Then show us. Show everyone the evidence that proves Kyoko went to the dojo.",
    100: "Don't bother trying to play dumb.",
    101: "That key is just the final piece of the puzzle.",
    102: "Your non-existent alibi, your clear motive, your attempts to frame Makoto for the crime.",
    103: "This all proves that you are the true culprit. You can't explain this away, so just give up.",
    104: "Not this again. You really are dead set on defending her, aren't you?",
    105: "That's enough. The time for idle chatter is over. A verdict is close at hand.",
    106: "I knew you were stubborn, but this is just getting ridiculous.",
    107: "I should know.",
    108: "Those words you just spoke, what do you mean?",
    109: "There's proof that you aren't the culprit.",
    110: "Is that what you're saying?",
    111: "I see. So that's what you meant.",
    112: "And if I had the key to your room,",
    113: "It would appear not.",
    114: "Well, does no one have a rebuttal?",
    115: "Have you decided to accept her assertion as fact?",
    116: "I see. So you still refuse to accept it.",
    117: "I suppose we have to admit that Kyoko didn't put the locker key in her room, that it was someone else.",
    118: "But of course, I have an alibi. From nighttime on, I was with you guys the entire time.",
    119: "I couldn't possibly have killed anyone, or put the key in Kyoko's room.",
    120: "There's only one other possibility I can think of.",
    121: "Someone could have had the key on them, then once they arrived at the scene, pretended to find it there.",
    122: "I don't see any other option.",
    123: "A lie?",
    124: "You are correct.",
    125: "You're giving up just like that? You admit to killing-",
    126: "Makoto, why are you staring off into space? Don't you have a rebuttal for Kyoko's claim?",

    7: "You said the DVD contains recordings of us being interviewed by the headmaster, right?",
    8: "What were the interviews about?",
    9: "And how did we answer?",
    10: "Indeed, we only have one path in front of us.",
    11: "What matters is figuring out what memories you took from us. That's what you're trying to say, right?",
    12: "The interview with the headmaster, taking that group photo, those can't be the only memories we lost.",
    13: "There must have been a purpose to it all, a reason for taking away our memories.",
    14: "Okay, so you want us to figure out who killed her before we do anything else.",
    15: "What makes you so sure?",
    16: "There can't be any doubt.",
    17: "In which case, there also can be no doubt that the mastermind is one of us.",
    18: "Recall what Makoto told us Monokuma said to him earlier.",
    19: "So if the mastermind is in the school, we have to assume it can only be that 16th student.",
    20: "That's a good point.",
    21: "Rather than wasting time bickering, we should put our minds to work solving this mystery.",
    22: "So then, what about the little matter of what happened last night?",
    23: "Makoto, you said you were attacked in your room by a masked assailant.",
    24: "If Mukuro had already been dead for several days, certainly it couldn't have been her.",
    25: "So who was it that attacked you?",
    26: "Hiro, Toko, Hina, and I all have solid alibis for that entire night.",
    27: "You're not going to tell us she was already dead before we arrived here or something, are you?",
    28: "then somehow she was killed in secret without any of us knowing.",
    29: "Then you're also saying the body was moved from the bio lab to the garden.",
    30: "Makoto's nitpicky nature seems to have surfaced with perfect timing.",
    31: "In other words, if the blue light is on, that means there's a body in that slot.",
    32: "Sounds like you're already convinced. Then can you tell us who was killed twice?",
    33: "And that's why the body had to be stored in the bio lab until the moment we found it in the garden.",
    34: "And Mukuro died from a number of wounds across her body.",
    35: "When you compare that to the stab wounds Junko suffered,",
    36: "So let me see if I have this straight.",
    37: "Junko, or someone going by that name, was stabbed to death with multiple spears.",
    38: "Then her body was kept in the biolab for however long before being dragged out again.",
    39: "Only this time, it was presented as the corpse of one Mukuro Ikusaba.",
    40: "It means that there haven't been ten victims, but nine.",
    41: "which also means that among the people we thought were dead, one is still alive.",
    42: "Are you sure about that?",
    43: "I admit, since Mukuro is undoubtedly dead, Junko does seem to be the only other explanation.",
    44: "But we saw her get impaled. She died right before our very eyes.",
    45: "If Junko were still alive, the death we saw would had to have been some kind of charade.",
    46: "But you yourself confirmed she was dead, did you not?",
    47: "That's all well and good, but how do you intend to solve the problem standing in your way?",
    48: "Junko absolutely died. Mukuro absolutely died.",
    49: "then that would make it Mukuro's corpse that showed up later.",
    50: "When we first met, none of us knew who anyone else was.",
    51: "So Mukuro could have simply told us her name was Junko,",
    52: "And we never would have known the difference.",
    53: "That would easily allow the two of them to switch places from the very beginning.",
    54: "If that's true, it was quite an elaborate plan to be sure, making it look like Mukuro was Junko.",
    55: "Then why haven't you been saying anything?",
    56: "So she killed Mukuro, who had taken her place, making it look like she'd died. And the real Junko...",
