    3: "He did it in secret, when nobody was in the dining hall.",
    4: "And then he went and stabbed Sayaka with it!",
    5: "Next, you're going to say you're not the killer, right? Go ahead and say it all you want.",

    7: "What if the idiot Slimmer Girl and Makoto are in on it together, and lying to protect each other?",

    14: "She grabbed the kitchen knife she had hidden away.",
    15: "Maybe she washed her hands after she escaped into the bathroom.",

    21: "D-Die! DIE!",
    22: "If we don't do something, we're all gonna die!",

    23: "But how can you know for sure there were six bottles?",
    24: "So, what's that matter?",
    25: "What does chess have to do with anything?",
    26: "Yeah! Wait, no, that's not what I mean.",

    36: "But there's no evidence I had anything to do with it!",
    37: "Shut up! Until two seconds ago, you were claiming you killed her!",
    38: "You don't know what you're talking about! I never went in the rec room!",
    39: "...Wha?",
    40: "Hiding in the rec room? Don't be ridiculous!",
    41: "W-w-w-why are you all ganging up on me? You're all nothing but vermin!",

    43: "YAAAAAAAHHHHH!",
    44: "Okay, it's my handprint.",
    45: "No, I swear, there's no way!",
    46: "I probably did kill her.",
    47: "After I read Sakura's note, I decided to go there early, so I went into the rec room.",
    48: "I didn't know what she might do if I didn't go, but I was too scared to face her head on.",
    49: "So I figured I'd just sneak in first and hide in the locker.",
    50: "Yes. And I saw you write my name. I saw you forge her dying message.",
    51: "So after he left, I jumped out of the locker.",
    52: "And put the magazine back on the shelf.",
    53: "I didn't mean to! I was in a hurry!",
    54: "After I put the magazine back, I heard a sound behind me like a monster growling.",
    55: "And when I turned around...",

    57: '"When I saw that blood, I fainted right there in front of the magazines."',

    1: "But Kyoko's standing right there.",
    2: "Impossible!",
    3: "Then she was wearing gloves before the explosion.",
    4: "I don't think so. The face was scorched beyond recognition.",
    5: "And there wasn't any description in the Monokuma file.",
    6: "If you're lying, you'll die a cruel and unusual death.",

    12: "It must have been the Hope's Peak Academy headmaster after all.",

    14: "He's right. It had to be around then.",
    15: "Oh, hold on! I remember this part perfectly!",
    16: "The body was wet. Dripping wet, in fact.",
    17: "I'm wrong? How?",
    18: "Are you saying only the mouth down south was wet? How dare you spew such indecent words!",
    19: "What do you mean?",
    20: "By denying the sprinkler, are you trying to deny my entire existence?",
    21: "if you really think it wasn't a sprinkler!",
    22: "Y-You'd better tell us why!",
    23: "So they only got the top wet? The bottom was completely dry? What a brutal maniac!",
    24: "Oh, then I guess the sprinklers really didn't do it.",
    25: '"So that was her motive?"',
    26: "You mean, someone else's blood? Where would they get something like that?",
    27: "It's... the knife we gave to Makoto?",
    28: "It's the same one we gave to Makoto!",
    29: "What a horrible man you are, Makoto.",
    30: "And it wasn't because of the knife, right?",
    31: "Then there's only one other thing.",
    32: "The Monokumafile says she was hit with a blunt object, about as thick as a metal pipe.",
    33: "How is that even possible? If you hit someone with that, it'd cave their skull in completely!",
    34: "No way! The balance would be all off! You wouldn't be able to swing it with any kind of power!",
    35: "I wouldn't mind testing it on you if you want.",
    36: "I'd love to scoop out that nasty brain of yours, throw it on the ground and spit on it!",
    37: "We already know? I knew we could count on you, Master!",
    38: "Hey! How dare you backtalk Master? You have no right!",
    39: "Talking back to master?",
    40: "You have no right!",
    41: "It's similar to Aesop's fable about the bundle of sticks.",
    42: "One stick is weak, but put them together, and they become strong. It's meant to teach cooperation.",
    43: "How is it harsh? Are you even listening?",
    44: "Master would never hide something from me!",
    45: "Y-you! What are you trying to imply?!",
    46: "What are you talking about?",
    47: "What do you mean?",
    48: "So the idea that we all lost our memories...",
    49: "You're not gonna show us something indecent, are you?",
    50: "What kind of question is that?",
    51: "Why? Why would you say yes to something like that?",
    52: "Then, we really...",
    53: "But how could someone just steal our memories?",
    54: "Exactly. You're just making stuff up. There's no way the Mastermind is here.",
    55: "The mastermind is probably a million miles away!",
    56: "Because masterminds always lurk off in the background, right?",
    57: "How do you know? Did you find some evidence or something?",
    58: "But how'd they manage to survive all of this?",
    59: "I blame Makoto!",
    60: "Cuz! It's super weird how you're the only one who survived being executed!",
    61: "He's right. What more is there to talk about?",
    62: "Th-that doesn't make any sense!",
    63: "Because... because she had all those wounds before she ever came here!",
    64: "Isn't it obvious? She was the ultimate soldier, right? So that means... you know...",
    65: "She denied me before I could even say anything!",
    66: "Come on, I mean, you think I'm...",
    67: "I'm not weird, okay? At least listen to what I have to say before you deny me!",
    68: "Mukuro was the ultimate soldier?",
    69: "She must have been in a hundred different battles.",
    70: "So, when you think about it,",
    71: "Obviously, she got all those wounds in battle.",
    72: "You didn't deny me this timesy-wimesy!",
    73: "Ugh! You made me go all cutesy!",
    74: "T-to be denied so completely! Actually, it's kind of refreshing.",
    75: "Ah, m-maybe it's 'cause of all of Master's training!",
    76: "What are you laughing at?",
    77: "If she was, she would have been totally decomposed. Just like your brain!",
    78: "The bio lab? You mean on the fifth floor?",
    79: "Wow, you made everything sound so amazingly consistent.",
    80: "Suspicious? Why?",
    81: "But if that's true, then why doesn't the body count match?",
    82: "Murdered and... murdered again?",
    83: "Then the similarities match?",
    84: "\"We already know the answer to that. It's Mukuro! She's still alive!\"",
    85: "She took Junko's body!",
    86: "And made it look like she was the one who died!",
    87: "So, Mukuro is still alive! She's gotta be!",
    88: "Total silence? Then I must be right. I'm right, aren't I?",
    89: "The body we found in the garden...",
    90: "It wasn't Mukuro!",
    91: "That's right. She made it look like Junko's body was her.",
    92: "So the mastermind's true identity is... Mukuro!",
    93: "But if Mukuro's not the mastermind, then who's actually still alive?",
    94: "Then you're withdrawing your previous statement?",
    95: "S-switched places?",
    96: "Yeah, you're saying they switched? When could they even have done that?",
    97: '"Right when she was, uh, about to die? Like she used some kind of ninja replacement technique?"',
    98: "Then we'd already met her?",
    99: "\"It's not like you're an endangered species or something. How long do you plan to keep hiding?\"",
    100: "Y-Y-Your face!",
    101: "T-Twins!",
    102: "But if you're twins, why do you have different last names?",
    103: "Yeah, Master's way more perfect, cause on top of everything else, he's got that noble blood.",
    104: "When the group pictures were taken, and those interviews, it must mean...",
    105: "I got it! It must have something to do with our entrance day exams!",
    106: "A theme?",
    107: "H-how so?",
    108: "Then hurry up and tell us!",
    109: "This is a scene from a movie or something, right?",
    110: "If nobody can remember anything...",
    111: "This is the end for all of us. What other choice do we have?",
    112: "Who might remember?",
    113: "What?",
    114: "Are you telling me to swap places with her?",
    115: "No! Absolutely not! That'd be like forfeiting my entire identity!",
    116: "Achoo!",
    117: "But if she really did use foundation...",
    118: "Thank you.",
