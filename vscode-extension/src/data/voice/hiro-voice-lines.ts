    21: "Then it must have been him, right?",

    23: "Ah! That's the note I was telling you about! The one that told me where to go!",
    24: "Huh? Wait, this one's a little different. In my note it said:",

    26: "It's not the same?",
    27: "Then someone used that note to trick Taka! Just the same as me!",
    28: "The culprit really is a cold-blooded monster, telling people they found a way out.",
    29: "Whoa!",
    30: "Yeah, after seeing all this, Hifumi was super involved in this whole thing for sure.",
    31: "In fact,",
    32: "He was behind the whole thing. In fact, he's still alive!",
    33: "Anyway, when they were killed bothers me too, but there's something that's been bothering me even more!",
    34: "The weapon they used to kill Hifumi!",
    35: "Yeah, 'cause I mean, according to the Monokuma file,",
    36: "The way Taka and Hifumi were killed was almost the same, with them having similar fractures and all.",
    37: "But Justice Hammer 3 and 4 were still laying around in the nurse's office and equipment room, right?",
    38: "So if Hifumi was killed in the repository...",
    39: "The culprit would have had to grab one of the hammers, kill Ifumi,",
    40: "Then put the hammer back where they found it.",
    41: "But wouldn't that be seriously risky for him?",
    42: "Hell yeah, it's packed in there good and tight.",
    43: "I don't think it is possible. They were both killed with the same kind of thing, right?",
    44: "Well, one thing seems pretty clear.",
    45: "The murder weapon had to be one of the Justice Hammers!",
    46: "And, uh, that's about it.",
    47: "But seriously? A different weapon?",
    48: "Yeah, I see what you're talking about. Although I don't really get what it means.",
    49: "It has to be some kind of setup, right?",
    50: "So let's put the suit on, and then... Then she used the camera's timer to... To set up the picture!",
    51: "That's what happened! You put me to sleep and made me out to be the bad guy in all this!",
    52: "You dressed me up in that suit after I passed out!",
    53: "Then you just draped me across Fumi and had him carry my weight!",
    54: "You tried to make me look like the bad guy!",
    55: "No way!",
    56: "Wait! But my name isn't really Yasuhiro! It's... actually... Taro!"

    10: "DAMMIT!",
    11: "Uh, I mean, what I meant was, uh...",

    17: "At the scene of the crime, she had written out \"Toko\" in her own blood, right?",
    18: "It was her dying message, just like what you guys were talking about with Sayaka!",

    20: "You just don't know when you're beat, do ya?",
    21: "Huh?",
    22: "W-well, when we found Ogre's body! Duh!",
    23: "D-doesn't make sense?",
    24: "What doesn't make sense? Everything I said makes perfect sense.",
    25: "I can tell you exactly when I found the dying message.",

    29: "Guh-hah!",
    30: "Hold on! You're focusing on the wrong part! Why does it matter when I saw it?",
    31: "All you gotta do is read the Vienna Sausage Ogre left us, and we know who the killer is. Toko!",
    32: "Um, yeah?",
    33: "I think we can all agree Ogre wrote that message.",
    34: "100%! Without a doubt, she wrote it! And this is me talking, so you know it's true!",
    35: "Say what?",
    36: "*Cough* *Groan*",
    37: "Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what happened.",
    38: "B-because...",
    39: "BECAUSE I KILLED HER!",
    40: "Please, just let me explain what happened!",
    41: "I got Ogre's note, and so I headed to the rec room right before noon, just like it said.",
    42: "And when I got there,",
    43: "And that's all she said. After that, we just stood around in awkward silence.",
    44: "Suddenly, I heard her mutter something.",
    45: "As soon as I heard that, I just knew, I knew she was gonna try and kill me!",
    46: "She was going to kill me and make her escape!",
    47: "So of course I freaked out, and then...",
    48: "I saw my only chance. I grabbed the Monokuma bottle from the shelf and smashed it across her head.",
    49: "I... I hit her from behind, before she had any idea what was happening!",
    50: "Then she just went limp. I didn't see her move again after that.",
    51: "Once it was over, I pulled myself together. I realized if I didn't do something, I'd be caught and executed.",
    52: "So I wrote Toko's name in blood across a magazine on the table, and I ran away.",
    53: "Well, that's what happened. Go ahead. Roast me, boil me, do whatever you want.",
    54: "Huh?",
    55: "Oh! Well, uh...",
    56: "I didn't hide it. I'm sure I just left it sitting there on the table.",
    57: "That's right. I killed her.",
    58: "Um, so what do you want me to do?",
    59: "I don't really see why, but... Okay?",
    60: "I didn't want to, but I did it.",
    61: "I grabbed a Monokuma bottle from the shelf nearby.",
    62: "And I hid Ogre from behind, before she could do anything.",
    63: "Yeah, just once.",
    64: "After the first swing, the bottle shattered.",
    65: "And she went limp.",
    66: "Huh? Two?",
    67: "But... I only hit her once. How could she have two wounds?",
    68: "Yeah, Shogi is way better!",
    69: "No way! You killed her! I'm sure of it!",
    70: "I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong. That's just the kind of guy I am.",
    71: "Plus, I just remembered something that proves it.",
    72: "It was right after I got Ogre's Note.",
    73: "I was kind of nervous about it, so I went to the rec room early. You know, to stake it out or whatever.",
    74: "So I was waiting there, and that's when I saw her.",
    75: "I saw Toko go into the rec room!",
    76: "Pretty soon, Ogre showed up, and she went into the rec room.",
    77: "I assumed Toko was still in there, so I figured everything would be okay. That's why I headed in.",
    78: "But when I got inside, Ogre was all alone. Toko had disappeared!",
    79: "After the shock of thinking I'd killed someone, I forgot all about it!",
    80: "So, Toko, where the heck did you disappear to?",
    81: "Dang, she just straight up admitted it.",
    82: "Straight up again!",
    83: "Then, did you see what happened? Did you see me hit her?",
    84: "Well, that's awkward.",
    85: "It was your fault after all!",
    86: "Hey, come on! That's... you know...",
    87: "But anyway, I'm not the one that killed Ogre, so that's good.",
    88: "Odd. Huh?",
    89: "And you were taken by surprise when you saw Ogre covered in blood.",
    90: "So you smashed her head in with the Monokuma bottle?!",
    91: "Are you sure you didn't attack her while she was sitting in the chair?",
    92: "Then she must have moved the body after she killed her, right?",
    93: "All to make it look like I did it. Because when I hit her, she was sitting in the chair.",
    94: "Then... then what's the deal?",
    95: "Huh. So she just hid in there till everyone showed up and opened the door?",
    96: "And while everything was all confused and hectic, she just snuck out of the locker into the group.",
    97: "Ugh. Okay, then. Where was she hiding?",
    98: "How do you not know? You killed her!",
    99: "But if Genocide Jill didn't do it, that means Ogre didn't die from the shot to the head!",
    100: "What was it that killed Ogre?",
    101: "If it wasn't from Genocide Jill's attack...",
    102: "Then what was it?",
    103: "But if there wasn't a cut or anything, then what made her vomit blood?",
    104: "Poisoned?",
    105: "But you're the only one talking.",
    106: "Huh? Not in the rec room? Then I could have found it all along!",
    107: "Well, yeah, good point.",
    108: "Is that... the poison?",
    109: "Where'd you find it?",
    110: "Huh? But you just said that Section A was for supplements or whatever.",
    111: "Yeah, so? Why?",
    112: "Idiot! He just swallowed poison! We need to make him spit it out!",
    113: "Huh? What are you talking about?",
    114: "Holy crap!",
    115: "You know, I do remember Ogre saying that protein stuff was good for all kinds of aches and pains.",
    116: "So maybe she took it to try and help with the whole bleeding head wound thing.",
    117: "For real? Who was it?",
    118: "Then, Ogre's killer was...",
    119: "Just Hina?",
    120: "Then, maybe she moved in some weird direction on purpose to disguise her movements?",
    121: "Then everything Hina told us was a lie?",
    122: "Huh?",
    123: "Not me.",
    124: "So you're saying...",
    125: "Someone planted it there after we got the door open?",
    126: "It was Hina, right? She took it and gave it to Ogre.",
    127: "Wait, wait, wait. So, what was that powder doing on Ogre's foot?",
    128: "Wait, so you're saying...it was suicide?!"

    5: "They probably just got burnt up in the explosion!",
    6: "I'm not convinced! The ghost is just trying to fool us all!",

    12: "Jeez, man, you don't know women, huh? They're complicated like that.",
    13: "Okay, so then! Who's the real victim? First, we need to figure that out.",
    14: "If Kyoko really is still alive...",
    15: "Then who died?",
    16: "Then there's nothing else we can do, right?",
    17: "A cruel and unusual death! This I gotta see!",
    18: "Seriously? They really did something that humiliating?",
    19: "Okay, so...",
    20: "Man, after all this time, we finally got a glimpse of the literary all-star.",
    21: "What?",
    22: "So that means, Kyoko got it wrong?",
    23: "Then who's the real mastermind?",
    24: "Wait, no! There's a chance that there's some mystery 17th person who's been hiding all along!",
    25: "Seriously? Then one of us killed Mukuro?",
    26: "Me and Byakuya can both confirm that the body wasn't in the garden at-",
    27: "Well, it was after nighttime for sure. I'd say it must have been around 10 o'clock.",
    28: "So the murder must have happened after 10 p.m.",
    29: "The one who saw the body first was Toko, right? When she went to go get the pickaxe.",
    30: "So we can be totally sure the murder happened sometime between 10 at night and 9 in the morning.",
    31: "Which means from 10 p.m. to 7.30 a.m., you don't have an alibi.",
    32: "Yep, and Makoto doesn't have an alibi for most of that time.",
    33: "Man, you're totally wacko.",
    34: "Which means she must have been killed sometime between then and when the body was discovered at 9.",
    35: "So there's no way Makoto could have done it. I guess you had an alibi after all, good for you.",
    36: "If she had a motive, and no alibi, well then, I think it's pretty clear Kyoko's gotta be the culprit.",
    37: "So the reason the tarp was only dirty on one side",
    38: "is because the sprinkler got that side wet!",
    39: "It's cause that side was protected from the water!",
    40: "Since it was facing down toward the body,",
    41: "Of course it didn't get dirty!",
    42: "Well, maybe the culprit washed it, so nobody would know they'd used it.",
    43: "Oh, yeah, true.",
    44: "I know! They could have grabbed some of the blood packs from the nurse's office!",
    45: "That's what Hifumi did, right? When he pretended to be dead?",
    46: "So you're saying someone killed a chicken and then covered the body with its blood?",
    47: "Man, that's messed up!",
    48: "For serious, man! Which one of them did it?",
    49: "Hey, why don't we let luck decide? Let's flip a coin! 50-50 odds!",
    50: "See? Pretty good idea, right?",
    51: "The one we found stuck in the body before it exploded, right?",
    52: "According to the Monokuma file, the knife went all the way through, from front to back.",
    53: "So, what about it?",
    54: "Suspicious, very suspicious indeed.",
    55: "The knife we found stuck in the body came from Makoto!",
    56: "NOW I'M TOTALLY CONVINCED HE DID IT! TWELVE THOUSAND PERCENT CONVINCED!",
    57: "If he did have that knife before, then...",
    58: "That seals it! Makoto did it!",
    59: "Well, getting stabbed is what killed her, right?",
    60: "So there's no question!",
    61: "You took that knife of yours and killed her with it.",
    62: "Lies! We never talked about what killed her!",
    63: "Okay, fine! So what?",
    64: "Maybe you stabbed her twice. Once to kill her and once to cover it up.",
    65: "Oh, yeah, it sure did. I totally forgot about that.",
    66: "I'll tell ya, I bet some unknown quantum particle caused an atomic level spontaneous combustion!",
    67: "Well, yeah. She was already totally dead when that happened.",
    68: "Oh, yeah. Um, according to the Monokuma file...",
    69: "That's got to be it. There was evidence that showed she was hit on the back of her head.",
    70: "What about the wounds all over the rest of her body? They didn't have anything to do with it?",
    71: "Oh yeah, good point. If they were old, I guess they don't really matter.",
    72: "Oh! I bet it was the pickaxe!",
    73: "Well, maybe they held it the other way and hit her with the handle.",
    74: "No thanks. I bet you just hit me with the metal end and call it an accident.",
    75: "Ha ha ha ha! I feel the same way! Looks like we're on the same page this time!",
    76: "So what was it?",
    77: "An arrow? That's what the culprit attacked Mukuro with?",
    78: "You don't sound convinced. What's the problem?",
    79: "Damn, that's harsh.",
    80: "Byakuya, what are you hiding?",
    81: "I mean, Byakuya had a room key, right?",
    82: "Well, someone had to put the key in there.",

    29: "It doesn't matter if I remember or not.",
    30: "Even if I bought the whole amnesia thing, the idea that I would want to live here forever?",
    31: "That's just insane! How can I believe that?",
    32: "WHAAAT?!",
    33: "But when you think about it,",
    34: "Is the mastermind really here in the school?",
    35: "So we're the only ones here?",
    36: "It's not me! I'm not the mastermind!",
    37: "Oh, I get it. The only way he could have survived is if he was actually the mastermind himself, right?",
    38: "Yeah, well, how much time have we already spent talking about the murder?",
    39: "Hey, now hold on a second! You did read the Monokuma file, right?",
    40: "It made it pretty clear! Those wounds were made at least a few days ago!",
    41: "So they can't possibly be what killed her.",
    42: "W-what?",
    43: "Don't worry. There wasn't anything cute about it.",
    44: "But if that's what killed her...",
    45: "Then does that mean she's really been dead for who knows how long?",
    46: "Yeah, we were in the gym tearing you apart, so it couldn't have been any of us.",
    47: "On the contrary, we don't know anything other than that.",
    48: "And after she died, who knows how much time went by before we found her, right?",
    49: "But the culprit stashed her somewhere? She couldn't have been in the garden the whole time, could she?",
    50: "Then, she was being stored somewhere?",
    51: "Holy cow! How'd you notice that tiny little thing?",
    52: "Are you talking about unmasking the mastermind?",
    53: "Why does that matter? You gotta give me the bite-sized version here, man.",
    54: "You're saying a dead body just up and disappeared?",
    55: "Huh? Killed twice?",
    56: "Then, it's really true? Mukuro and Junko are the same person?",
    57: "Wait, so then...",
    58: "Gah! What does it all mean?",
    59: "Who is it? Who's behind all this?",
    60: "What do you say, Monokuma? Do you give up?",
    61: "Then both of them are dead, right? There can't be any kind of survivor story!",
    62: "I don't know anything about this \"switching places\" thing, but...",
    63: "That had to be Junko who got stabbed to death, right?",
    64: "Hold on. So you're saying the Junko we first met",
    65: "was actually Mukuro all along?",
    66: "Wait, so this whole thing was a set up from the very beginning?",
    67: "Oh, yeah! If everyone was in that video, of course Junko would have had to show up!",
    68: "COME ON! IT'S TIME YOU FINALLY REVEALED YOURSELF!",
    69: "Whoa! She's a totally different person now!",
    70: "What the hell is wrong with you?",
    71: "Like, Genocide Jill is crazy for sure, but this is a whole nother level of nuts!",
    72: "All right, then let's just get straight to the point. What memories did you steal from us?",
    73: "No fair! At least give us a hint!",
    74: "And plus, you haven't given us any hope anyway.",
    75: "What? Why the hell would having our memories make us not want to leave?",
    76: "What are you talking about? None of this makes any sense!",
    77: "You want us to remember or whatever, but",
    78: "When it comes to that crazy confusing video you showed us,",
    79: "I don't understand a damn thing!",
    80: "What do you say, Toko?",
    81: "That's enough! Just look at the stupid screen!",
    82: "Then you remember all the stuff it's showing?",
    83: "Is... now?",
    84: "That's all there is to it? Come on! There wasn't a single concrete description in there!",
    85: "How can the world just end? It's... it's the world!",
    86: "What the hell is this chick trying to say?",
    87: "I... I just don't know what's going on anymore.",
    88: "Nope. Nope. No, no, no. Nope. No. I mean, no matter what anyone says, uh-uh.",
    89: "Seriously? This routine again?",
    90: "I don't remember the last two years of my life.",
    91: "That... that's not possible!",
    92: "We've been living here for two years?!",
    93: "Hell no! That's impossible!",
    94: "I mean, I haven't gone to any awesome school events or anything!",
    95: "Heck, I've never even gone to a single class!",
    96: "Plus, if two years have passed...",
    97: "HOW FREAKING OLD AM I?!",
    98: "Huh? Hey, why's my name written on it?",
    99: "Sure, whatever you want, but I've never seen this notebook before in my life.",
    100: "It's kind of similar. No, even more than that.",
    101: "What the? This is absolutely my handwriting, without a doubt!",
    102: "But how is this... I don't remember ever writing in this thing.",
    103: "No! No way!",
    104: "Lies! It's all one big lie!",
    105: "What?",
    106: "You mean, we trapped ourselves in here?",
    107: "We get it. We get it, okay?",
    108: "You're totally awesome, right? We get it already!",
    109: "So help us! I'll do anything! Just help me!",
    110: "Even if you don't, you've still got the upper hand in all this!",
    111: "You mean... we just...",
    112: "All my fortune-telling senses are telling me not to leave this place!",
    113: "*Maniacal Scream*",
    114: "But to live means moving forward, right?",
    115: "So even if it's hard, even if we're scared, we don't have any choice, do we?",
    116: "I want to keep on living. I want to open the next door. There must be something new waiting for me!",
    117: "So that's why. That's why!",
    118: "No matter what, I need to get out of here!",
    119: "The whole fortune telling thing doesn't matter anymore. What matters is my own gut feelings.",
    120: "*Giggle*",
    121: "I... I've decided to have faith in myself!",
    122: "We just gotta pull the lever, right?"
