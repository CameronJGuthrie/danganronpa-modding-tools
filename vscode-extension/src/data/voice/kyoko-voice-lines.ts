    1: "Before we move on and start the trial, can I ask a question real quick?",
    2: "What's going on with those pictures?",
    3: "Let's draw our conclusions after we've presented our arguments. Otherwise, what's the point of the trial?",
    4: "I don't think that's true at all. I'm sure if we keep at it, something new will reveal itself.",
    5: "So in other words, two people can work together, but one of them has no chance of profiting from it.",
    6: "Hold on. It's still too early to decide conclusively that Makoto is the killer, wouldn't you say?",
    7: "Because you see, if the room did belong to the killer, then they did something most bewildering.",
    8: "And until we unravel that little mystery, you simply can't declare that he's the killer.",
    9: "Something was missing from the scene of the crime that by all rights should have been there.",
    10: "You know what I'm talking about, don't you?",
    11: "No. If that were the case, they would have had to do something about the body itself, not just her hair.",
    12: "The killer got rid of it all, of course, to remove any trace that they had ever been there.",
    13: "precisely. It's simply beyond reason to believe that the room's owner and the killer are one in the same.",
    14: "No. There are other reasons that prove why Makoto couldn't have done it.",
    15: "Do you remember anything remarkable about the bathroom at the scene?",
    16: "Sayaka was attacked in the main room first, then fled into the bathroom, right?",
    17: "And how did the killer get into the bathroom? Did they have any trouble with it?",
    18: "It's fairly certain that the killer had some trouble getting into the bathroom.",
    19: "There was clear evidence left behind. Do you remember, Makoto?",
    20: "In trying to bypass the lock, they ended up nearly removing the entire doorknob.",
    21: "This is another most bewildering act for the room's owner. It proves Makoto is beyond suspicion.",
    22: "You still don't see? Okay then.",
    23: "Let's take another look at how the incident unfolded. Hopefully that will help you understand.",
    24: "The incident took place in Makoto's room.",
    25: "Sayaka was first attacked in the main room.",
    26: "She then fled into the bathroom.",
    27: "So the reason the door didn't open was just because it was stuck.",
    28: "But the killer didn't know that and assumed it was locked, so they tore apart the doorknob to get in.",
    29: "The killer could easily make that mistake, thanks to one important detail about the scene of the crime.",
    30: "And yet, he's absolutely right.",
    31: "Well, to be more specific.",
    32: "What the killer didn't know was that Makoto and Sayaka had switched rooms.",
    33: "Which is what led to the misunderstanding about the bathroom. If Sayaka had been in her own room, then...",
    34: "Ultimately, we can't know if it came open by force or simply by accident, but...",
    35: "What if her being scared was a lie?",
    36: "I know you don't want to consider it, but look at this and tell me, can you still deny the possibility?",
    37: "I found a notepad during my search, and I shaded in the top sheet with a pencil.",
    38: "And these are the words that appeared.",
    39: "It's a pretty old-fashioned technique, but even the classics can be surprisingly useful sometimes.",
    40: "Oh, and I should also mention, I found the notepad on the desk in Makoto's room.",
    41: "Which means, only someone who had been in Makoto's room before the incident could have written it.",
    42: "So, Makoto. Did you write this?",
    43: "Of course you didn't. Because the note also bears a perfectly legible signature. Sayaka's signature.",
    44: "The note was likely her way of getting in touch with a certain someone.",
    45: "She must have slid it under their door to let them know she wanted to meet with them in secret.",
    46: "That's right. The nameplates got switched, just like the rooms themselves.",
    47: "As a result, the nameplate on Sayaka's room actually had Makoto's name.",
    48: "And the nameplate on Makoto's room had Sayaka's.",
    49: "Plus, their rooms are right next to each other, so switching the nameplates would be no problem.",
    50: "And the one who switched the names was... Well, of course it wasn't you, right, Makoto?",
    51: "You can also infer as much from her note.",
    52: "She specifically tells the reader to check the nameplate.",
    53: "She would only have written that if she knew the nameplates had been switched.",
    54: "She wanted someone to come to the room she was in, and also hide the fact that it was Makoto's room.",
    55: "To understand that,",
    56: "We first need to understand what happened AFTER she invited the person into the room.",
    57: "That's where the answer lies.",
    58: "Yes, I think you're right.",
    59: "If they got attacked with the kitchen knife, maybe they grabbed the sword as a defensive impulse.",
    60: "In that situation, there wouldn't be any time to actually unsheathe the sword.",
    61: "Sorry, but I don't think Sayaka used the sword to defend herself.",
    62: "because she never held the sword at all. There's a certain part of her body that makes this clear.",
    63: "Now do you understand? She wasn't a blameless victim in this.",
    64: "Makoto, right now you just need to concentrate on figuring out the answer to this mystery.",
    65: "If we can't uncover who murdered Sayaka, it's over for all of us.",
    66: "The dying message. She wrote something on the wall behind her, remember?",
    67: "1-1-0-3-7. Written in her own blood. There must be a clue about the killer hidden in there.",
    68: "Of course. It's because they're not numbers.",
    69: "No. It's not random at all.",
    70: "She wrote that message on the wall behind her as she was leaning up against it.",
    71: "In that position, she couldn't move to write normally, and had to write upside down as it were.",
    72: "And as a result,",
    73: "When you look at it standing in front of her, it ends up getting flipped.",
    74: "Try it for yourself if you want. Write something sitting like her, and the letters will be inverted.",
    75: "If you're not the killer, then why did you try to destroy the evidence?",
    76: "You know what I'm talking about, right, Makoto? The evidence Leon tried to get rid of?",
    77: "As the killer stabbed Sayaka, they must have gotten some of her blood on them.",
    78: "and to dispose of the shirt covered in the victim's blood, they threw it into the incinerator.",
    79: "And the killer didn't notice. If they had, they most certainly would have panicked.",
    80: "Isn't that right, Leon?",
    81: "Are you finally starting to understand? The answers to all the riddles are right here.",
    82: "All you have to do is look at the scene to know that the killer never actually went inside the trash room.",
    83: "The shards of broken glass, the incinerator left running, the piece of shirt that escaped the fire.",
    84: "If the killer had been on cleaning duty, the evidence would have been taken care of much more thoroughly.",
    85: "You still won't admit it? Okay, then.",
    86: "Makoto. Go ahead and review the incident one more time to make his crime perfectly clear.",
    87: "And with that, we can end this.",
    88: "So, Leon, do you object to anything that's been said?",
    89: "Well then, I guess this is as good a time as any to present the evidence that proves you did it.",
    90: "\"Makoto. I believe you're in possession of that evidence?\"",
    91: "When the killer broke the bathroom doorknob, they didn't use anything from your room to do it.",
    92: "So what did the killer use?",
    93: "When the killer removed the screws from the doorknob, they didn't use anything from your room to do it.",
    94: "Instead, they must have used something that belonged to them.",
    95: "And let me say this right now.",
    96: "I lost it isn't an excuse at this point.",
    97: "The killer must have been considerably confused, with no idea how they actually got the door opened.",
    98: "Rotate the image 180 degrees."

    1: "and the wound on the victim's head is consistent with the shape of the dumbbell.",
    2: "As far as I'm concerned, there's no mistake and no room for doubt on this one.",
    3: "There is more to it. Think about it.",
    4: "We just talked about the differences between this case and past Genocide Jack incidents.",
    5: "The proof you're looking for is hidden in there.",
    6: "Hold on a second.",
    7: "I agree with you though. I think you're on the right track.",
    8: "Why are you so sure she couldn't get in? There's still one other way she could have gained access.",
    9: "Well, to explain that,",
    10: "Why don't we take a little break from the trial? I'd like you all to come see something.",
    11: "Don't worry. This'll make the whole trial more exciting. I'm sure that thought must please you.",
    12: "Oh, I have no doubt it'll meet your lofty expectations. So, shall we go?",
    13: "I'd like you to examine the victim's body one more time.",
    14: "Be sure to examine the entire body very carefully. Take your time.",
    15: "Be sure to check her entire body, and I believe we will solve this particular mystery.",
    16: "Yes, well. I don't know his reason for hiding it, but the fact is, Chihiro was not a girl, but a boy.",
    17: "And because the victim was male, he would have had no problem gaining access to the boys' locker room.",
    18: "So then, there should be no issue with Makoto's initial assertion.",
    19: "The victim was killed in the boys' locker room, and was then later moved to the girls' locker room.",
    20: "And the killer could have easily used Sayaka or Junko's handbook to get into the girls' locker room.",
    21: "\"I still don't understand the motive for moving the body, but... yes, that does seem plausible.\"",
    22: "What about you, Makoto? After everything we've learned, do you still think Byakuya's the killer?",
    23: "No, I'm with Makoto. If there's any doubt whatsoever, we need to explore every possibility.",
    24: "Because if we're wrong, we all die here.",
    25: "No. You already have what you need to make the connection.",
    26: "You know who the killer is.",
    27: "Think back to the track jacket and duffel bag the killer disposed of.",
    28: "Focus on the details of these items, and it should become obvious who was waiting for him.",
    29: "Maybe, but we can make certain inferences if we just take the time to talk it out.",
    30: "Perhaps. Let's explore that and talk a bit more about the jacket he took.",
    31: "You heard him, right? What he just said without even realizing it?",
    32: "First of all, we know where Chihiro was headed.",
    33: "He was on his way to go exercise.",
    34: "So next we have to ask:",
    35: "Why did he choose the specific tracksuit that he did?",
    36: "No, that can't be it.",
    37: "The bag and clothes were surely disposed of by the time we began our investigation.",
    38: "It would appear you've dug your own grave.",
    39: "That's right. However...",
    40: "Mondo was my target all along. I had my suspicions about him from the very beginning.",
    41: "Well, if you're asking if there was some huge hint or something...",
    42: "The way he was talking and acting after the murder was a little different from usual. That's it, really.",
    43: "That's a good question.",
    44: "There was a certain turning point that tipped me off.",
    45: "Maybe you didn't notice it, Mondo, but you tend to refer to men and women differently.",
    46: "You only call guys \"dude.\" For girls, it's \"chick.\"",
    47: "And after he was killed, you happen to refer to him as dude.",
    48: "Once I picked up on that, it occurred to me that Mondo knew something we didn't.",
    49: "No. I'm not the frightful one.",
    50: "Not nearly as frightful as someone capable of murdering a friend.",
    51: "It's true. My reasoning on that is pretty shaky.",
    52: "For a fact.",
    53: "then we can only assume that someone's figured out its weakness.",
    54: "You know what the weakness is, right, Monokuma? So, what is it?",
    55: "I think it's a necessary piece of information if you want this to be a fair trial.",
    56: "What if they found out by accident?",
    57: "What if the killer took their own handbook into the sauna, not knowing its weakness, and it broke?",
    58: "They'd realize it was broken, of course, and it wouldn't be hard to figure out why.",
    59: "And once they had Chihiro's handbook, they knew they had an easy way to dispose of it.",
    60: "Let's test Makoto's assertion.",
    61: "If what he says is correct, then Mondo...",
    62: "You broke your own handbook."

    1: "There's no way you could think the same person made both of them.",
    2: "It's still far too early to reach that conclusion.",
    3: "Besides, there's no hurry to decide who did it.",
    4: "Before we rush to a verdict, shouldn't we explore every single possibility?",
    5: "Instead of seizing on one viewpoint, the truth is uncovered by analyzing things from every angle.",
    6: "let's review this series of unfortunate events from the beginning. Maybe we'll uncover something new.",
    7: "I see. The whole thing sounds exceptionally complicated.",
    8: "It certainly seems to me that these are not a simple series of connected events.",
    9: "Rather than a single series of events, I think we have to consider each murder a separate situation.",
    10: "And from there, we can uncover the contradictions surrounding all of them.",
    11: "Now then, let's get started, beginning with what happened to Taka.",
    12: "So, regarding Taka's death...",
    13: "I wonder if he died before Hifumi.",
    14: "Or perhaps it was after?",
    15: "It must have gotten broken when he was attacked by the killer, because as of last night,",
    16: "So if it wasn't broken after six last night, then he must have been attacked around six this morning.",
    17: "That's right. Taka was killed before any of the other incidents took place.",
    18: "Now, if Taka was killed around 6, then everyone's alibis for his murder go out the window.",
    19: "Because when he was killed, we hadn't met up in the dining hall yet.",
    20: "For now, we can't get fixated on who did it, or we'll just keep going around in circles.",
    21: "So instead of who, I propose we start talking about how.",
    22: "In particular, I think we need to figure out how Hifumi's body got moved.",
    23: "Well, what if I told you there was a way to make the impossible possible?",
    24: "If the dead body were to move itself.",
    25: "And you know that, how?",
    26: "Are we really so sure about that?",
    27: "Maybe the announcement was intended to signal someone else's discovery.",
    28: "Okay then, let's take another look at the events surrounding the discovery of his body.",
    29: "Then it should become clear whether he was really alive or not.",
    30: "So let's assume that Hifumi was still alive in the nurse's office.",
    31: "He pretends to be dead. Then when he's alone, he wipes his glasses clean so he can see.",
    32: "Then he stands up and walks out on his own two feet.",
    33: "And with that, the impossible task of moving his copious corpse becomes possible, wouldn't you say?",
    34: "The fridge in the nurse's office contains packs of blood for emergencies. He probably used one of those.",
    35: "And if Hifumi was still alive at that point, the disappearance of Taka's body is easily explained.",
    36: "It should be perfectly obvious who must have moved Taka's corpse.",
    37: "He convinced us all he was dead, and when he saw his chance, he dragged Taka's body to the repository.",
    38: "So, Hifumi wasn't just another victim in this case. He was one of the assailants.",
    39: "If you're having trouble, would you like me to show you one more piece of evidence?",
    40: "Oh, absolutely. The single biggest fact pointing to his involvement has yet to be revealed.",
    41: "\"You know what I'm talking about, right, Makoto? The item he took off of Taka's lifeless body?\"",
    42: "But remember what the note said.",
    43: "What time did it say to meet?",
    44: "Hifumi had the note meant for Taka, while Taka's corpse still grasped a small piece of that note.",
    45: "There's only one way to explain it.",
    46: "Exactly. Which proves that he was an accomplice in the murder.",
    47: "He was killed in the repository, so he must have been killed not long after transporting Taka's body.",
    48: "But that only really applies if there's one murder, right?",
    49: "In this case, however, there were two murders.",
    50: "If there'd only been one murder, then yes, the idea of an accomplice isn't really worth considering.",
    51: "Naturally, if only one person can be saved per murder, an accomplice has no risk versus reward benefit.",
    52: "The payoff for working together. The reward that balances out the risk of taking part in a scheme.",
    53: "There's no point in being someone's accomplice if there's no benefit to you.",
    54: "However, if there were some potential mutual reward for the risk, then cooperation becomes possible.",
    55: "I think that's what the true killer told Hifumi. They would each have an accomplice for their crime.",
    56: "And based on the case's events, Hifumi would have been the first one to act, murdering Taka.",
    57: "They made him carry out the first murder so he couldn't back out of helping them later on.",
    58: "Simple. Are we sure that's really a picture of the suspect dragging Hifumi away?",
    59: "Surely there are other explanations than the one you've offered up.",
    60: "That's certainly within the realm of possibility.",
    61: "The one being dragged off in that picture isn't Hifumi, but the person in the robot suit.",
    62: "We've simply been led to believe that it's the other way around.",
    63: "And the strange costume might only exist to lead us astray even farther.",
    64: "If you saw someone wearing something like that in this situation, of course you'd notice and be suspicious.",
    65: "Is it? I don't think it's ridiculous at all.",
    66: "I'm not so sure that was a mistake.",
    67: "I think the suit was designed from the beginning to be used the way it was.",
    68: "He did say Yasuhiro, but are we sure he was really pointing the finger at Hiro?",
    69: "Think back to how Hifumi used to talk to us.",
    70: "How did he refer to each of us?",
    71: "Exactly. I know I heard him say Mr. Nayagi more than once, for example.",
    72: "So if Hifumi did mean to say Hiro's name, he would have said his last name, Hagakure.",
    73: "Random chance. Now isn't that a convenient explanation?",
    74: "No. There's no reason to think he would have said the name any different than normal.",
    75: "But he must have run out of energy before he could say any more.",
    76: "Hifumi was trying to tell us something.",
    77: "He wanted us to know the killer's last name. Yasuhiro."

    1: "Hire, hold on.",
    2: "When did you see that dying message of hers?",
    3: "But if you recall, Hina was very adamant about keeping you away from the scene of the crime.",
    4: "So it's hard to believe that's when you actually saw the message for yourself.",
    5: "That's right. Looking through the shelf, I found the magazine with the dying message on it.",
    6: "I found it right there at the scene of the crime, after we'd started the investigation.",
    7: "And I can tell you when I found the dying message.",
    8: "It was only after the investigation had begun.",
    9: "I found the magazine tucked away on the magazine shelf.",
    10: "When I pulled it out, I saw her final words.",
    11: "Actually, can we even be sure Sakura wrote that message in the first place?",
    12: "Hiro could very well have written it himself.",
    13: "That would explain how he knew about the message in the first place.",
    14: "I figured as much.",
    15: "No. I think there's more to Hiro's story.",
    16: "There's one thing that Hiro's story just now doesn't explain.",
    17: "And until we figure that part out, we can't consider the case closed.",
    18: "I don't see any reason he would lie now, after already confessing to the crime.",
    19: "I don't think there's any question about that.",
    20: "If they went to the trouble of hiding the magazine,",
    21: "They must not have liked what was written on it.",
    22: "What he means is that Hiro isn't the killer.",
    23: "Hiro, tell us what happened one more time.",
    24: "If we go through it once more, it should become clear he's not Sakura's killer.",
    25: "Just tell us what happened one more time when you attacked Sakura.",
    26: "You hit her from behind.",
    27: "And you only hit her once, is that right?",
    28: "That's right. She had two separate wounds on her head.",
    29: "Two wounds means she was struck twice. What's more, both attacks must have come from a Monokuma bottle.",
    30: "It's not just because of her head wounds. It's also because of the Monokuma bottles themselves.",
    31: "There's something very suspicious about those bottles.",
    32: "Once you understand that point, you'll understand why two separate Monokuma bottles must have been used.",
    33: "Think back. After the incident, there were four Monokuma bottles left on the shelf, right?",
    34: "And we found pieces of a bottle on the ground, along with the chess piece it had inside.",
    35: "For now, just note that there were four intact bottles and one broken bottle.",
    36: "But originally, there were six bottles in total, meaning one has gone missing.",
    37: "That's easy.",
    38: "If you look at what the bottles all had in common, it should become clear.",
    39: "I guess you don't know too much about chess, do you? Then let me explain.",
    40: "In chess, there are six different pieces, the king, the queen, the rook, knight, bishop, and pawn.",
    41: "What was left intact at the crime scene were the king, rook, bishop, and pawn. Just those four.",
    42: "And on the ground was the night.",
    43: "No. It's clear that the missing bottle is connected to this case.",
    44: "Think about what state the missing bottle must have been in. Maybe then you'll understand.",
    45: "So from this, we can surmise that two bottles were actually broken at the scene of the crime.",
    46: "but someone did their best to clean up the pieces of one of the bottles, along with the figure inside.",
    47: "but when they did, they must have left behind a few too many pieces.",
    48: "Which is only natural. They certainly had no way to measure the exact right number of pieces to remove.",
    49: "The second wound on Sakura's head came from that second bottle.",
    50: "Given all the evidence, this is the only possible conclusion.",
    51: "From there, we can conclude that it wasn't Hiro who delivered that second blow.",
    52: "Wouldn't you agree, Toko?",
    53: "And there's the matter of the magazine. You must have been in the rec room when the incident took place.",
    54: "I'm sure she didn't disappear, but maybe she found somewhere to hide.",
    55: "Okay then, let's just compare it to your hand, shall we? That'll clear everything up, right?",
    56: "Give us the details, Toko. What happened between you and Sakura?",
    57: "And when it was all over, you collected the pieces of the bottle to get rid of the evidence, didn't you?",
    58: "Even as strong as she is, she must have still been reeling from Hiro's attack.",
    59: "Plus, the biggest mystery of all, the locked room, still has yet to be explained.",
    60: "Until we take care of that, we can't say this case has been properly settled.",
    61: "If that's all it was, the file wouldn't have specified vomited blood.",
    62: "Not to mention, I didn't find any cuts inside her mouth.",
    63: "No, I'm not into dead bodies. What I'm into is solving mysteries.",
    64: "Can I see that bottle for a second?",
    65: "This is... It's protein powder.",
    66: "Hold it!",
    67: "I'm not convinced.",
    68: "You say that, but I'm still not convinced.",
    69: "Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying it because of some misguided sentimentalism.",
    70: "But there's still that one unsolved mystery, and I'm not convinced.",
    71: "Hina. If you really are the killer, explain it. How did you create that locked room?",
    72: "No, it doesn't. But the fact that you won't tell us concerns me.",
    73: "And if I do?",
    74: "He's right. It makes it look like you wanted people to suspect you.",
    75: "You didn't notice?",
    76: "Listen, Hina. Could you go into a bit more detail?",
    77: "Tell us more about when you switched the poison and the protein.",
    78: "Go ahead, Hina. Start from the moment you arrived at the chem lab.",
    79: "\"And is that when you spilled the powder in front of that part of the shelf?\"",
    80: "I see. Okay then, go on.",
    81: "And you spilled some of the powder on the ground in front of the shelf.",
    82: "Okay, and then?",
    83: "You lied to us. Plain and simple.",
    84: "If you look at the footprints, your movements in the chem lab are obvious.",
    85: "The powder had already been spilled when you came in, and you went straight to Section A.",
    86: "So you never went to Section C. Whatever you did there, it only involved Section A.",
    87: "And the footprints aren't the only problem with her account.",
    88: "Before I explain that part, I'd like to submit some new evidence.",
    89: "Are you sure? After all, you're the one that gave it to me.",
    90: "It was hidden inside the bottle of poison you gave me.",
    91: "I'm amazed you of all people would miss such a vital clue. A truly grave oversight.",
    92: "I found this.",
    93: "It had sunk to the bottom of the bottle.",
    94: "And the hidden clue was exposed, thanks to you ingesting the powder.",
    95: "I couldn't have solved the mystery without you. So, thank you for that.",
    96: "Oh, you still don't realize? Well then.",
    97: "Makoto, why don't you explain it?",
    98: "You're right, it must be. Of course that leads to another question.",
    99: "How did a shard of glass from the window get inside this bottle of poison?",
    100: "And then, once the room was opened, the bottle somehow got moved back to the shelf in the chem lab.",
    101: "Meanwhile, the protein can we found at the crime scene was planted there.",
    102: "That had to be after the locked room was opened. In other words, after Sakura died.",
    103: "You're right. We do need to explain that.",
    104: "But before we do, there's something I'd like to confirm with everyone here.",
    105: "It has to do with the protein can.",
    106: "After Sakura's body was discovered, did anyone move it or trip over it or anything like that?",
    107: "Not at all. Just answer to the best of your ability.",
    108: "Okay then, that settles it.",
    109: "That proves that the protein can found its way to the murder scene after the room was opened.",
    110: "When it comes to that protein can,",
    111: "There's not a doubt in my mind.",
    112: "Until the locked room was unlocked.",
    113: "It absolutely was not in there.",
    114: "If that were the case, that would explain the can being on top of the glass.",
    115: "And that's made everything clear, hasn't it?",
    116: "As long as it was a locked room, it only contained the bottle of poison and not the protein can.",
    117: "But once the room was opened up, they were switched, and as a result...",
    118: "The protein can wound up in the rec room, and the bottle of poison returned to the chem lab.",
    119: "Precisely. She was alone in a locked room. All she had was the poison. What other possibility is there?",
    120: "exactly what happened.",
    121: "Before we get to that, we need to clarify one other thing.",
    122: "We need to establish who exactly got the poison from the chem lab and took it to the rec room.",
    123: "What do you think, Makoto?",
    124: "On the contrary, we know for a fact she went to the chem lab, right to the section full of poisons.",
    125: "But why did Sakura pay a visit to Section C in the first place?",
    126: "The only explanation is that she was looking for poison. After all, that's all that section contained.",
    127: "I'm sure she locked herself in so nobody could stop her from doing what she did.",
    128: "She sat there, drank the poison, and breathed her last breath.",
    129: "and the empty bottle of poison rolled around the locked room until we came and opened it.",
    130: "At that point, someone grabbed the bottle and snuck it out of the room.",
    131: "And that was you, wasn't it Hina?",
    132: "You did it to throw off the investigation, didn't you?",
    133: "When we found her body, you stayed right there near the door.",
    134: "Because you already knew Sakura was dead.",
    135: "and because the bottle of poison had rolled near the doorway.",
    136: "And the more I think about it, the more I realize how unusual your actions were.",
    137: "You said you were going to go get everyone else.",
    138: "But your real intention was to go to the chem lab and switch out the containers, wasn't it?",
    139: "Once you were at the chem lab, you headed straight to the section where the protein powder was kept.",
    140: "There, you took the powder and poured it into the bottle of poison you'd grabbed from the rec room.",
    141: "When you left the lab, all you had was the empty protein can.",
    142: "Thinking about it like that, the footprints make perfect sense.",
    143: "So, Sakura committed suicide.",
    144: "In order to hide this fact, Hina undertook a series of actions to undermine the investigation.",
    145: "As long as you could disguise the truth, you didn't care if we blamed you for her death.",
    146: "That's why you didn't bother to get rid of such obvious evidence, right?",
    147: "The footprints in the powder, and the bottle of poison? Vital pieces of evidence, and yet...",
    148: "You still haven't realized?",
    149: "We don't all act according to calculations and cost-benefit diagrams. That's what makes us so complicated.",
    150: "That's what you don't understand, and that's why you couldn't solve this case.",
    151: "See? Didn't I tell you?",
    152: "When you dismiss other people's feelings, it'll always come back to bite you in the end.",
    153: "Oh yeah, that's right."

    11: "Which is why I can't let that happen.",
    12: "Of course I'm not. I have no reason to kill anyone.",
    13: "This is a trap the Mastermind has laid for us.",
    14: "I'm not the only one without an alibi. Makoto's explanation is still insufficient.",
    15: "The sprinklers didn't get the body wet, but that doesn't mean the murder happened when he said it did.",
    16: "Because you see, there is a way the body could have avoided getting wet.",
    17: "All it would take is covering the body with a certain something to keep it from getting wet.",
    18: "You catch on quick.",
    19: "You're right. All you'd have to do is cover the body with the tarp, and that'd take care of the water.",
    20: "In fact, that's exactly what the killer did.",
    21: "The dirt pattern on the tarp can attest to that.",
    22: "Only one side of the tarp got dirty, because that's the side that got covered in water.",
    23: "The side that faced down over the body, meanwhile, kept perfectly clean.",
    24: "This proves that the killer used the tarp to keep the body from getting soaked.",
    25: "most likely so they could cloud the issue of when the murder actually took place.",
    26: "In other words, to create an excuse exactly like the one Makoto just gave us.",
    27: "And what might that be?",
    28: "By covering the body with a tarp,",
    29: "The killer prevented it from getting wet.",
    30: "More than that, what if the very blood we saw on the body was meant as a kind of camouflage?",
    31: "What if, after the killer used the tarp to avoid the sprinklers,",
    32: "They then covered the body in blood that didn't belong to the victim.",
    33: "No, that's not what happened this time.",
    34: "the killer got the blood from right there in the garden.",
    35: "I wonder if the killer had to get the blood from the scene so they wouldn't be spotted walking around.",
    36: "Anyway, there's no denying that a chicken went missing, which provides a basis for my theory.",
    37: "I have to agree, that certainly is strange.",
    38: "Maybe they didn't apply the blood at the scene. Maybe they covered the coat in blood beforehand.",
    39: "When you discovered the body, was it wearing the coat like you normally would?",
    40: "Then that settles it.",
    41: "Here's what happened. The murder took place before the sprinklers went off.",
    42: "But the body didn't get wet, because the killer covered it with the tarp.",
    43: "Then, later, at the same time the killer was gathering up the tarp,",
    44: "They pulled the coat over the body, the coat they'd already covered in blood.",
    45: "This series of cover-ups was meant to disguise the actual time the murder occurred.",
    46: "They wanted us to think the murder happened sometime after the sprinklers had gone off, at 7.30.",
    47: "That actually wouldn't have been all that difficult.",
    48: "They already had the coat ready, so they just had to grab the tarp and pull the coat over the body.",
    49: "They'd be done in no time.",
    50: "Hina. After you met up with Makoto in the dining hall, did you two stay together from that point on?",
    51: "Then he had plenty of time to spare, wouldn't you say?",
    52: "Don't bother saying it's not possible.",
    53: "\"I've never been to the dojo!\"",
    54: "And how does that prove anything?",
    55: "It was... in my room?",
    56: "I was just... protecting you.",
    57: "Wait.",
    58: "I'm warning you. Don't make this mistake. I'm not the killer.",

    60: "Can you tell me I'm wrong?",
    61: "Exactly what I said.",
    62: "I'm not the killer.",
    63: "You should understand that more than anyone here.",
    64: "You stated a theory earlier.",
    65: "You said I hid the evidence of my crime in the dojo locker.",
    66: "And then left the locker key in my own room, correct?",
    67: "But could I really have done that?",
    68: "Then obviously I had no way of getting in.",
    69: "Without my room key, I couldn't have possibly put the locker key in there myself.",
    70: "Am I wrong?",
    71: "Then you're finally starting to understand.",
    72: "What do you mean, time's up? There's no time's up. Since when have we-",
    73: "You said it. The burden of proof is on you.",
    74: "So let's hear it. Where's this lie, then?",
    75: "I didn't have the key to my room.",
    76: "Because I'd given it to Byakuya.",
    77: "There's no doubt about that, right?",
    78: "so I couldn't possibly have gotten into my room.",
    79: "Someone other than me must have put it there. That's the only explanation.",
    80: "Then I guess that's it.",
    81: "No, I'm simply recognizing that I lost.",

    18: "No, that isn't actually what killed her. It was something entirely different.",
    19: "Wouldn't you agree, Makoto?",
    20: "What if, when we discovered her body, she'd already been dead for several days?",
    21: "If that's true, then naturally the wounds that killed her would appear to be however many days old.",
    22: "You're wrong.",
    23: "Are you finished?",
    24: "As a matter of fact, it's hard to imagine any other possibility.",
    25: "When examining her body, I found that her stomach and head wounds came after she was already dead.",
    26: "You're wrong. Even without seeing their face...",
    27: "There's another part of the attacker we can use to prove it wasn't her.",
    28: "If you insist, I don't mind showing you.",
    29: "What do you think? I'll show you the one thing that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it wasn't me.",
    30: "Awful, isn't it?",
    31: "It happened when I was first learning to be a detective. I was inexperienced.",
    32: "If it means we get another step closer to unmasking the mastermind, it doesn't really bother me.",
    33: "My scars should suffice as proof.",
    34: "\"Makoto. Did the person who attacked you have scars like mine?\"",
    35: "then this much has been made clear.",
    36: "There can be no doubt that the one who attacked Makoto is the true mastermind.",
    37: "Not at all. You can say whatever you want.",
    38: "So when the killer moved the body to the garden, they must have grabbed a tarp to wrap it in.",
    39: "Then they simply left it as it was to protect against the sprinklers, and put the coat on it afterwards.",
    40: "There is no evidence. I was simply explaining what I think happened.",
    41: "But you seem to be getting pretty worked up about it, wouldn't you say?",
    42: "Now that the conversation has turned to the topic of the Biolab, you must be getting pretty nervous.",
    43: "Because the key to uncovering your secret identity is hidden within that room, isn't it?",
    44: "You see, the biolab contained an inconsistency, one so major it can't be overlooked.",
    45: "Such a child. Oh well, just ignore him.",
    46: "Calm down, Makoto. He wants you to get upset.",
    47: "and it was set up so that when a slot had a body in it, a blue light would turn on.",
    48: "That's simple. Just recall who's died here so far, and it should become clear.",
    49: "It may very well be that none of them disappeared.",
    50: "Including Monokuma's executions, there have apparently been ten deaths, but there were only nine bodies.",
    51: "That's the point I'm trying to make.",
    52: "Could easily have happened. No. It is what happened.",
    53: "It was Mukuro, of course.",
    54: "Before she was killed as Mukuro Ikusaba, she was killed as someone else.",
    55: "All you have to do is look at those bodily injuries of hers, and that will become obvious.",
    56: "Yes, and those are the only fatal injuries that match up.",
    57: "That explains why those two bodies are actually one and the same.",
    58: "She was 5 foot 6 inches tall and weighed 97 pounds. Her vitals were 31, 21, 32.",
    59: "Everything in her profile is consistent with that corpse.",
    60: "This case hasn't been decided just yet.",
    61: "You haven't given up already, have you, Makoto?",
    62: "I think we need to look at this from the opposite direction.",
    63: "Let's assume Junko is still alive. If so, how could she have survived?",
    64: "She could have hidden it with foundation or something like that.",
    65: "If she did, it likely melted away in the explosion, exposing the tattoo after the body was extinguished.",
    66: "Plus, there were the fake nails found on the hands of Mukuro's body.",
    67: "They were the same fake red nails she was wearing when we all met for the first time.",
    68: "Correct. Even if there was no tattoo on her hand, I couldn't say for certain it wasn't Mukuro.",
    69: "So I'm glad nobody noticed that glaring hole when we were trying to figure out who attacked Makoto.",
    70: "But too bad for you, Monokuma. You can't deny it anymore.",
    71: "The reason such an elaborate plan was possible is because the two of them were working together.",
    72: "What's wrong? Lost the will to fight back?",
    73: "I believe everything Makoto said is true.",
    74: "Junko and Mukuro switched places before we met either of them.",
    75: "With this, the identity and the crimes of the mastermind have been exposed.",
    76: "Give it up, Junko. The game's over.",
    77: "And that's why you switched identities?",
    78: "In other words, Mukuro's death was a one-sided, premeditated act of betrayal.",
    79: "Just as I suspected.",
    80: "When Mukuro was killed, she must have been as surprised as anybody else.",

    94: "But just like Hiro, I have no memory of ever writing in it.",
    95: "What are you talking about?",
    96: "The reason it felt so short was because... Our memories of the time in between had been completely removed?",
    97: "But by that point, we'd already spent two years together at the school.",
