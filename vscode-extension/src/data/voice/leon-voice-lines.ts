    1: "Okay, so the murder weapon was a kitchen knife, but where does that get us?",
    2: "I mean, we all know Makoto killed her, right?",
    3: "Well, we can talk all we want. It's not going to change that conclusion.",
    4: "So I guess there's no question that the kitchen knife was the murder weapon.",
    5: "But where does that get us?",
    6: "So he really did do it!",
    7: "Uh, I hate to have to ask, but just to be sure, Sakura's...",
    8: "Right.",
    9: "Okay, then why wasn't there any hair on the ground?",
    10: "So what? You're saying he wouldn't break the door in his own room?",
    11: "But if the only choice you have is to break it, you break it. There's nothing bewildering about it.",
    12: "At that point, the killer had to try and bust down the door.",
    13: "Because Sayaka had locked it.",
    14: "Huh? What are you talking about?",
    15: "Majority rules? Do you really think that's a good idea?",
    16: "Maybe Sayaka just dropped the key somewhere and the culprit picked it up. That's possible, right?",
    17: "Okay, then who did it?",
    18: "How the hell could you possibly know that's what broke her wrist?",
    19: "What? How the hell can you not think that?",
    20: "An insult, obviously.",
    21: "It's easy just to say, hey, decide who did it.",
    22: "But there just aren't any more clues, right?",
    23: "Dining? Wait, what did you say?",
    24: "- What?",
    25: "What the hell are you talking about? It's just a coincidence.",
    26: "It's just a bunch of random squiggles that happen to look like my name.",
    27: "That sounds like one hell of a stretch to me.",
    28: "I'm the killer? You can't just go and say shit like that.",
    29: "Huh?",
    30: "W-w-w-what?",
    31: "That's right. There are plenty of other people here with shirts like mine.",
    32: "With just that one little charred piece, there's no way you can say for sure who it belongs to.",
    33: "Oh, yeah, that's a good point. I think I know what you're going to say.",
    34: "You can't reach the incinerator without opening the gate in front of the trash room, right?",
    35: "And obviously, you wouldn't be able to hit the switch to turn it on, either.",
    36: "You need the key to get in, and the one with the key was the person on cleaning duty.",
    37: "So the killer had to be whoever was in charge of taking care of the trash, right?",
    38: "The key to the trash room.",
    39: "Whoever was on cleaning duty must have had it, right?",
    40: "And you'd have to get close to the incinerator in order to destroy the evidence.",
    41: "Which means the only possible suspect is whoever had the trash room key.",
    42: "Hey, come on! What the hell is this?",
    43: "Wait, no, just hold on.",
    44: "Th-that's right! There's no way! It'd be impossible!",
    45: "Do you, do you have any idea how stupid you sound right now?",
    46: "Y-you can't be serious! I... I...",
    47: "I'M NOT THE KILLER!",
    48: "These goddamn shipper brains have got it all wrong, I'm telling you!",
    49: "Listen to me! What the hell do you mean, end this?",
    50: "DO I OBJECT?",
    51: "Hell yes, I object! Of course I do! I object! I object! I object!",
    52: "I mean, all of this is just a bunch of stupid theories. You need evidence. Where's the evidence?",
    53: "Without evidence, it's all bullshit. It's bullshit and I refuse to acknowledge it.",
    54: "I refuse to acknowledge you! You're stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid!",
    55: "STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!",
