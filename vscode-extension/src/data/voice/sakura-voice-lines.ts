    1: "Next is the subject of the murder weapon.",
    2: "So what was used to kill her?",
    3: "Which means that knife must be the murder weapon.",
    4: "I can.",
    5: "Me.",
    6: "I stayed in Hina's room last night.",
    7: "But I'm a girl.",
    8: "Actually, there is one other possibility. Right, Hina?",
    9: "That's the only possibility.",
    10: "And thinking back on it, she was acting kind of unusual.",
    11: "When she came into the dining hall, she didn't even look at us. She just went straight to the kitchen.",
    12: "As she left, she said she just wanted a drink of water. But most likely...",
    13: "I would like to hear these reasons.",
    14: "Yes, now that you mention it, that is true.",
    15: "so they had no idea how unnecessary their actions were.",
    16: "Hmm, yes. How did the killer get inside?",
    17: "Hmm, it certainly would seem that way.",
    18: "That reminds me. There was a replica sword at the murder scene. Was that perhaps used during the fight?",
    19: "And they killed her with it.",
    20: "So you're saying the sword was initially used to defend against an attack from the knife.",
    21: "Indeed. These are all the actions of an assailant.",
    22: "The tables were suddenly turned on her, and she died at the hands of the one she'd planned to murder.",
    23: "But even if that really is an N, N037, doesn't make any more sense than before.",
    24: "But is one scrap of fabric enough to conclude that Leon is guilty?",
    25: "But if you can't get past the gate, you couldn't possibly turn on the incinerator, could you?"

    metadata: { index: 4595 },
    1: "Chihiro's fatal injury.",
    2: "It appears it was a head wound.",
    3: "This one is so different from the one we've come to know.",
    4: "Emotive.",
    5: "Do you really expect any of us to believe you?",
    6: "You say that, but do you really expect any of us to believe it?",
    7: "A pattern?",
    8: "You're referring to my protein coffee, aren't you?",
    9: "While I was in the girls' locker room earlier, I spilled some protein coffee on the carpet.",
    10: "But I noticed that after the murder, the stain had been totally scrubbed away.",
    11: "That's definitely the stain from my protein coffee.",
    12: "I am struck silent by how quickly you gave up.",
    13: "So if she didn't use Leon's handbook, and she didn't modify her own handbook...",
    14: "Very well. I'll do it.",
    15: "No, it's okay. I think Chihiro would rather have a girl examine her.",
    16: "So just leave this to me.",
    17: "Okay, here I go.",
    18: "I'm sorry, Chihiro. Please excuse the intrusion.",
    19: "Her entire body? I know you say that, but…",
    20: "What? This is... What is this...",
    21: "*Screaming*",
    22: "Not possible. It's not possible.",
    23: "This... this girl is...",
    24: "is a boy!",
    25: "I wouldn't joke about this.",
    26: "That's very true.",
    27: "Isn't there a single clue that might lead us to who did it?",
    28: "Perhaps someone saw the victim at some point. Even that might be enough for now.",
    29: "It seems likely that the culprit destroyed them to get rid of any evidence.",
    30: "But Hina and I had invited him to exercise with us plenty of times, and he always declined.",
    31: "Well, if I remember right, there was a decent variety of tracksuits to choose from.",
    32: "Do you think there might be some connection between the culprit and Chihiro's jacket?",
    33: "Then, Mondo, how did you know what color Chihiro's tracksuit was?",
    34: "But if the handbook is supposed to never break, and two of them broke in quick succession, then...",
    35: "Meaning the culprit somehow knew its weakness.",
    36: "What do you mean, by accident?"
  },
  [Chapter.Chapter_3]: {
    metadata: { index: 4631 },
    1: "No, the differences are bigger than that, I think.",
    2: "So what you're saying is...",
    3: "\"So what is it? What needs to be clarified?\"",
    4: "Okay, that explains the tarp. And the dolly?",
    5: "I'm not sure that really matters.",
    6: "It seems like it'd be awfully hard to push that dolly if you couldn't bend over.",
    7: "That's true. It seems impossible to put the suit on or take it off without help.",
    8: "To be clear, whoever did move the body, it couldn't have been Hiro in the robot suit, correct?",
    9: "Perhaps. But where do we go from here?",
    10: "I don't disagree, but our lives are on the line. If this is what it takes, we have to do it.",
    11: "All right then, let's take another look back at what happened.",
    12: "I suppose we could start with this morning.",
    13: "Four of us gathered together in the dining hall, Makoto, Hina, Kyoko, and myself.",
    14: "We waited there for quite a while, but nobody else showed up, so we went to look for everyone.",
    15: "That was around 8 a.m.",
    16: "Soon after that, Hina found Celeste in the rec room and quickly came to get Makoto and me.",
    17: "That was when we saw Celeste's picture and discovered that her assailant had been wearing a strange costume.",
    18: "As it turns out, it was robo-justice.",
    19: "It also soon became clear that this same robo-justice had abducted Hifumi.",
    20: "We were soon joined in our search by Byakuya and Toko, and then went on to find Hifumi in the library.",
    21: "He was injured, so we took him to the nurse's office and resumed our search for the suspect.",
    22: "But not long after leaving the nurse's office.",
    23: "Meanwhile, we had just discovered Taka's body in the equipment room.",
    24: "We must have found both bodies at almost exactly the same time.",
    25: "Because we heard the same announcement not long after we discovered his body.",
    26: "Then we remembered we'd left Toko passed out in the equipment room, so we hurried back again.",
    27: "But when we got there, we discovered that now Taka's body had also gone missing.",
    28: "Next thing we knew, we were searching the school for two missing dead bodies.",
    29: "And after some time...",
    30: "What makes you say that?",
    31: "But if that's true, then he was killed well before Hifumi.",
    32: "That may be true in the case of Taka's murder.",
    33: "But all of our alibis still hold true for Hifumi's death.",
    34: "Anyway, we all have rock-solid alibis for when we heard Hifumi scream.",
    35: "Since all of us were there together, clearly none of us could have killed him.",
    36: "Are you saying Hifumi wasn't carried out of the nurse's office, but simply walked out on his own?",
    37: "Are you saying that when we first found Hifumi in the nurse's office?",
    38: "There's a chance he was actually still alive.",
    39: "So when we found Hifumi the first time in the nurse's office, he wasn't actually dead yet.",
    40: "Meaning he wasn't actually found dead until we came upon him in the repository.",
    41: "Then, was he really still alive?",
    42: "I see your point. And the only people here who wear glasses are...",
    43: "That's a good point.",
    44: "But that means he took part in the murders.",
    45: "Mmm, yes, his pants.",
    46: "6 a.m., I believe.",
    47: "Which is where Taka was killed, I see.",
    48: "Taka died clutching the note. Hifumi tried to free the note from his death grip.",
    49: "leaving behind only one small scrap.",
    50: "Did I get all that right?",
    51: "Whoever did is the mastermind, the true killer.",
    52: "So, he must have been killed after Taka's body vanished, but before we found both bodies in the repository.",
    53: "The weapon.",
    54: "He's right, though. I don't understand it either.",
    55: "The Monokuma file makes it clear that they were killed using similar instruments.",
    56: "But if the hammers were already laying around those other rooms...",
    57: "So then, what was used to kill Hifumi?",
    58: "What was used to kill Hifumi?",
    59: "Was it Justice Hammer 3?",
    60: "Maybe Justice Hammer 4.",
    61: "If that's true, that would explain the Monokuma File's note about the wounds being similar.",
    62: "That is how the rule was explained to us.",
    63: "What do you mean?",
    64: "I understand how an accomplice could be involved, but then who was the one pulling Hifumi's strings?",
    65: "She let out a blood-curdling scream.",
    66: "I remember her saying that too, but I don't understand what's so strange about it.",
    67: "Your confusing statements don't make any sense. You're only making things more complicated.",
    68: "But the name, he said, doesn't apply to anyone here.",
    69: "It would have to be you, Celeste. You haven't told anyone what your real name is.",
    70: "Thank you.",
    71: "Thank you."

    48: "You see, the mastermind took control of my family's dojo and demanded I become their tool.",
    49: "I couldn't let it be destroyed under my watch, so even if it meant my own life, I had to protect it.",
    50: "That's how I saw things.",
    51: "And what the mastermind wanted from me was nothing less than murder.",

    61: "But I've decided. The one I'm going to kill is...",
    62: "...myself.",
    63: "If it can save you, then sacrificing my own life could have no greater meaning.",
    64: "Whatever you think of me, please know that you are all my most treasured friends.",
    65: "Finally. Hina, I want to apologize to you especially.",
    66: "I never saw you as my enemy. You were only ever my friend, who I wanted to help as much as possible.",
