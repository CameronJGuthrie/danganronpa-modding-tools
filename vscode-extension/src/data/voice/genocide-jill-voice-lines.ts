    1: "Well, hello there! Is it me you were hoping to see?",
    2: "So you figured it out, huh? Well, whatever. What are you gonna do?",
    3: "I'm the ultimate murderous fiend, Genocide Jack! Or better yet, let's go with Genocide Jill!",
    4: "Not Toko. That's a loser name, and what happened is a textbook split personality.",
    5: "So what if one of them happens to be a serial killer? You should turn a blind eye to one's faults.",
    6: "*Evil Laugh*",
    7: "Like they say, sound and murderous mind, sound and murderous body.",
    8: "Yes, well, the world is composed of a front and a back, you know.",
    9: "Just like how every inning has a top and a bottom, or how in the depths of every truth lives a little lie.",
    10: "Behind every dark and gloomy soul lives another that shines as bright as the sun!",
    11: "*laughs*",
    12: "What's up?",
    13: "Well, I'll tell you! I am the mastermind of all masterminds!",
    14: "Just kidding!",
    15: "\"Sure, I'm a bloodthirsty maniac, but life is pain, right? To live is to hurt other people!\"",
    16: "\"It's a necessary evil if you want to survive. The act of living itself causes pain for everyone.\"",
    17: "Just kidding again!",
    18: "Interesting. Very, very, very interesting.",
    19: "But sorry, as much as I hate to admit it, I'm not the culprit!",
    20: "Maybe so, maybe so, but nevertheless it's the truth!",
    21: "Sorry, but I didn't kill anyone!",
    22: "Oh, an alibi, huh? Now we're talking.",
    23: "*crying*",
    24: "Uh-oh, you don't know?",
    25: "Well then, human garbage, let me tell you!",
    26: "I murder with passion and conviction!",
    27: "I consider myself a professional, and I have a very particular way of doing things.",
    28: "Imagine you go to a fancy Italian restaurant, they're very picky about the noodles, the sauce, everything!",
    29: "But what happened to Chihiro?",
    30: "It'd be like if that same Italian restaurant started using ragu or Chef Boyardee.",
    31: "THIS IS NO CREATION OF MINE!",
    32: "That's right! In my recipe of murder, if the bloody message is the tortellini...",
    33: "Then the arrangement of the body would be the pesto sauce!",
    34: "And guess what? I used my own specially designed scissors for the murders and the arrangement!",
    35: "Like I said, I'm a professional, so naturally I'm very picky about the tools I use.",
    36: "And, and and and and and and and, you know what else?",
    37: "Big Mac said there's two differences, but he's wrong.",
    38: "Listen up, Big Mac! There's actually one more difference!",
    39: "My word, you really didn't notice? Take a look at who the victims were in each Genocide Jack case!",
    40: "There's a pattern there just waiting to be discovered.",
    41: "Figure that out, and it'll be plain as death why I couldn't have possibly killed that little lolly girl.",
    42: "Bingo! Bullseye right on the money!",
    43: "That's right! The people I kill with such passion and conviction are all adorable little men!",
    44: "I can't believe I said it! I'm so embarrassed!",
    45: "I can't help it! I'm just a full-throttle boy-on-boy fangirl, and the mopey side of me just hates it!",
    46: "But now I'm on the fast track to becoming a full-fledged fan-madam!",
    47: "Would an Italian chef suddenly start making ramen just because they're both noodles? Don't be stupid.",
    48: "I have too much passion and conviction to cross that line. That's the absolute reality of the one and only.",
    49: "Quiet, lowly cur!",
    50: "I would never kill for a reason as petty as mere survival.",
    51: "And if by some fluke I did kill to survive,",
    52: "Why would I bother with the message and arrangement? It'd make me the obvious suspect!",
    53: "Plus, whatever reason I have for killing, I would never leave out my prized scissors.",
    54: "Who would go out of their way to use a big, stupid, heavy dumbbell?",
    55: "ANY SCISSORS?",
    56: "I don't just use any scissors. I only use my own set of high-class, envy-of-the-entire-world scissors!",
    57: "Are you sure about that?",
    58: "Da-da-da-da!",
    59: "That's right! So I can kill anywhere, anytime!",
    60: "Why would I resort to dumbbells or rope when I have my trusty scissors by my side?",
    61: "Go ahead! Tell me I'm wrong! You can't, Ken! You gutter dogs! All of you!",
    62: "Not to mention, I have no clue how to tie a good knot, so rope's totally out of the question anyway!",
    63: "So, he rearranged the scene to disguise it and make it look like I put my stamp on it!",
    64: "The adorable Glasses Man was behind it all! I'm on fire!",
    65: "What? The difference between the cases?",
    66: "You want me to explain it again?",
    67: "When I want to kill, I use my very own special scissors.",
    68: "And I use those same scissors to arrange the body.",
    69: "I don't disagree with not disagreeing!",
    70: "I bet those massive jugs of hers were TOTALLY FAKE!",
    71: "What is this? Some kind of secret girl-on-girl action? Is that what you two are about?",
    72: "Then... he was a cross-dresser? Now I'm really on fire! I wish I had killed him!",
    73: "This is a most titillating situation!",
    74: "What a marvelous friendship!",
    75: "Then the only reason he could have known what color the tracksuit was...",
    76: "is if he saw Cherry with it before he died! That's the only possibility!",
    77: "So, how about it? Did you see the tracksuit or didn't you?",
    78: "Are you a witch? She's a witch! You're positively frightful!",
    79: "Hmm? What do you have there?",

  [Chapter.Chapter_3]: {
    metadata: { index: 6363 },
    1: "Shut your murdering mouth, murderer!",
    2: "Now that's a bold assumption!",
    3: "So the killer just crouched down,",
    4: "And carted the body off to the repository!",
    5: "Yeah, it'd be totally impossible! Not that I can say for sure myself.",
    6: "Well, I mean, isn't that just a matter of taking off the suit when you're ready to move the body?",
    7: "What a pain in the ass!",
    8: "That's totally true. We're all in the clear.",
    9: "Well, don't forget, I was passed out in the equipment room the whole time.",
    10: "Besides, I didn't do either of them anyway.",
    11: "Huh? Later on?",
    12: "Oh, oh, oh, I know, I know!",
    13: "Because he was super good at playing dead! Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom!",
    14: "A few tissues is all I need to keep my glasses clean.",
    15: "He figured if he was gonna play dead, he should go all out, so he just dumped it everywhere!",
    16: "but he got crazy with it and had to wipe his glasses off when he was done. God, what an idiot!",
    17: "The door was locked?",
    18: "PANTS!",
    19: "Hello? Over here! Objection! Objection!",
    20: "I don't really understand what's going on, but... Hifumi had that letter, right?",
    21: "So whoever wrote it wasn't drawing out TikTok, they were drawing out Huffy!",
    22: "Oh, yes! Why must you ruin it every time?",
    23: "Huffy had the note, right?",
    24: "Than the person it was intended for!",
    25: "Must have been happy!",
    26: "The time doesn't matter!",
    27: "The note has nothing to do with TikTok.",
    28: "What the hell are you talking about?",
    29: "Hmm, well, when you put it like that...",
    30: "No further objections.",
    31: "Stuff down his pants, no less!",
    32: "Stop trying to steal the spotlight, you stupid walrus!",
    33: "Sounds like a Justice Hammer 5 is about to make its appearance!",
    34: "Check out MurderGear.com slash HammerTime for more info.",
    35: "That's problem numero uno right now!",
    36: "Then the fortune-telling idiot is the culprit after all!",
    37: "Indecent?",

  [Chapter.Chapter_4]: {
    metadata: { index: 6400 },
    1: "Haha! Guess who's back!",
    2: "My fault! Master's fault! When our faults combine, they soar to even greater heights!",
    3: "Well, to be honest, Miss Morose and me don't actually share our memories.",
    4: "So I can't really say what was going on.",
    5: "But I was just minding my own business, sleeping peacefully, when someone shook me awake!",
    6: "Was it a prince paying me a visit? I wondered, so I opened my eyes to see.",
    7: "Splatter everywhere! I was not prepared for that!",
    8: "And, well, I guess it took me by surprise.",
    9: "I got so startled, I smacked her with the first thing I could find, which I guess was a bottle.",
    10: "No, she's terrible! Thanks to her, I murdered someone who wasn't an adorable boy for the first time ever!",
    11: "I wasn't about to die for some woman! If I'm gonna go down, I want it to be for killing Master!",
    12: "But I just can't catch a break, you know? Fate's got it out for me.",
    13: "Cuz normally, Sakura should have been able to dodge my attack no problem!",
    14: "Your wish is my command, darling!",
    15: "I was just sleeping peacefully.",
    16: "And all of a sudden, Sakura was right there in front of me!",
    17: "I remember waking up right in front of the magazine shelf.",
    18: "You got it, Ice Master! Good!",
    19: "Right where I woke up!",
    20: "I killed her there in front of the shelf.",
    21: "Hey, come on now, look at me! I can't carry anything heavier than my own scissors!",
    22: "There's no way I could move a muscle-bound heavyweight like that!",
    23: "I don't know! What's this whole locked room thing about anyway?",
    24: "I think the fact that I don't know proves I didn't kill her, thank you very much.",
    25: "So you're dead set on blaming me, huh?",
    26: "\"You even checked in there? God, you really ARE into dead bodies!\"",
    27: "Hahahaha! You're making me go all weak in the knees!",
    28: "Everyone, quiet! Shut up and listen to Master!",
    29: "And that's where the poison came from? Section C?",
    30: "Huh!? Master!?",
    31: "Oh, no! Master's in real trouble!",
    32: "You have to drink some water! You can't just swallow powder! It'll stick to your throat!",
    33: "What's wrong with you, Big Mac? You're being awfully pushy!",
    34: "What's so strange about that?",
    35: "Same here.",
    36: "Huh? So Sakura, who was apparently murdered, just poisoned herself?",
    37: "And it was only on our instep, right?",
    38: "I don't believe it! I don't believe it any more than I believe I can fly!"

    2: "Huh? What video?",
    3: "WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!",
    4: "Oh, nice to meet ya!",
    5: "Aye, aye! Roger, you got it, Captain!",
    6: "I don't have all the details, but...",
    7: "Of course it does!",
    8: "Of course I do!",
    9: "I only answer questions when someone bothers to ask me. I'm the quiet type, you know?",
    10: "Huh? What's the matter, Master? Do you really not remember the tragedy?",
    11: "Oh no! You seriously forgot? Maybe I can help you remember! With a kiss...",
    12: "Well, I can't really say if it happened or if it's still happening.",
    13: "But it was the biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history.",
    14: "Because it's all because of that event!",
    15: "Are you serious? I'm talking about the way the world is now!",
    16: "Copy that, darling!",
    17: "Okay, so this big, awful, tragic event, they started just calling it the tragedy, happened about a year ago.",
    18: "It was so big and so bad that even this murderous fiend went pale at the sight of it.",
    19: "I guess you could say what happened was man-made.",
    20: "But it was more on the level of a world-wide natural disaster!",
    21: "Either way, there's no doubt that it was the biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history!",
    22: "And as a result, in basically no time flat!",
    23: "The world turned out the way it did, and that's that.",
    24: "Well, it just so happens I don't know any of the specifics!",
    25: "Miss Morose saw it all play out in real time, so why don't you ask her?",
    26: "I couldn't live up to Master's expectations! To die! To die! This is the true tragedy!",
    27: "Wooza wooza! Is something wrong?",
    28: "Hmm, and whose pocketbook is that?",
    29: "No, even I can't laugh at that.",
    30: "She's saying she'll let us live!",
    31: "*laughs*",
    32: "I don't care either way. I'm fine with whichever one is more interesting.",
    33: "Actually, I may not look like it, but I always hated school.",
    34: "Hell, no matter how I look, still hate it!",
    35: "Oh, but no matter what, Master has to come along with us!",
    36: "Meh.",
    37: "I can keep on living as long as I have my master's love!"
