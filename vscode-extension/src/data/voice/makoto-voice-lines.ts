    1: "And the killer really is one of us, right?",
    2: "Just a second, Chihiro. Try to remember how my room looked.",
    3: "With the way things had been damaged, I think we can definitely assume there was a struggle.",
    4: "Between Sayaka and the killer, of course.",
    5: "No. I do think it was a knife, but not just any knife. I'm almost positive it was a kitchen knife.",
    6: "After the murder, we discovered that one of the knives from the kitchen was missing.",
    7: "Hold on a second, I'm-",
    8: "Okay, wait, hold on. I didn't take the knife from the kitchen.",
    9: "\"Well, what if I have a witness?\"",
    10: "What do you think, Hina?",
    11: "Remember what you were telling me earlier?",
    12: "Just to be perfectly clear, the knife disappeared while you were in the dining hall, correct?",
    13: "And at any point while you were there, did you ever see me come into the dining hall?",
    14: "The knife disappeared while Hina was in the dining hall, but I wasn't there the entire time.",
    15: "In other words, there's no way I could have taken the knife.",
    16: "Anyway, I didn't go to the dining hall, and I didn't take the knife.",
    17: "So I'm not the killer!",
    18: "\"Then Sayaka is the one who took the knife?\"",
    19: "I'm sure... I'm sure she just took it for self-defense.",
    20: "What?",
    21: "No! You're wrong!",
    22: "That's right. There wasn't a single hair on the floor.",
    23: "Yes, and if I were the culprit,",
    24: "Why would I need to get rid of all the hair in my own room?",
    25: "It wouldn't be unusual at all to find my hair at the crime scene if the crime scene is in my room.",
    26: "\"Evidence that the killer had trouble getting into the bathroom.\" \"You're talking about the doorknob, right?\"",
    27: "The doorknob from my bathroom. It was completely broken.",
    28: "See how the top part was unscrewed, and the doorknob's about ready to fall off?",
    29: "The reason my bathroom didn't open wasn't because it was locked.",
    30: "After all, the girls' rooms are the only ones with locking bathrooms, right?",
    31: "Because it was stuck.",
    32: "My bathroom door doesn't fit in the frame quite right.",
    33: "Monokuma over there can testify to that.",
    34: "the killer must not have realized that it was my room.",
    35: "Definitely something I wouldn't do, since I would have known exactly why it wasn't opening, right?",
    36: "No, that can't be it either.",
    37: "Because Sayaka was already scared, remember? That's why she asked me to switch rooms in the first place.",
    38: "Knowing what she'd been through, I just can't believe she would have opened the door for anyone.",
    39: "Huh?",
    40: "W-what the hell is that supposed to mean? Why would she lie about something like that?",
    41: "Huh?",
    42: "No, I didn't, but...",
    43: "But why? Why would she write that?",
    44: "The nameplates on my and Sayaka's rooms got switched.",
    45: "Right?",
    46: "Me and Sayaka were the only ones who ever knew about us switching rooms.",
    47: "So the only other person besides me who would even know to switch the nameplates was Sayaka.",
    48: "What?",
    49: "Sayaka suggested I should hold on to it. I thought it might come in handy if I had to defend myself.",
    50: "It seems pretty likely that the killer used it to break Sayaka's right wrist.",
    51: "All you have to do is take a good look at her broken wrist, and it should become pretty clear.",
    52: "Right there where her wrist is all swollen. There's something glittery there. See?",
    53: "It sure is. Specifically, the gold coating from the replica sword.",
    54: "You barely have to touch that stuff, and it'll stick right to you.",
    55: "and there's some on her wrist because...",
    56: "That's what makes the most sense to me, anyway.",
    57: "Actually, no. I don't think the fight started with the sword.",
    58: "because the sword sheath had been scratched.",
    59: "See? There's a gash in it, like someone cut into it with something sharp.",
    60: "If the sword was used first, there wouldn't be any explanation for the scratch on the sheath.",
    61: "If you were going to attack with the sword, you'd take it out of the sheath first, right?",
    62: "You're talking about her palms, right?",
    63: "The palms of her hands were perfectly clean, so I don't think she ever picked up the sword.",
    64: "Like I said before, the gold coating on that sword comes right off. All you have to do is touch it.",
    65: "In fact, if you look, you'll notice that a lot of the gold has already come off the handle.",
    66: "It's safe to assume that's because whoever used the sword got some of it on their hands.",
    67: "There's really no way she could have picked it up and come away completely clean.",
    68: "Sorry, but I don't think so.",
    69: "No, that's not it at all.",
    70: "According to the Monokuma file, Sayaka's time of death was around 1.30 AM.",
    71: "In other words, at night time. And the water in the bathroom shuts off at night time, right?",
    72: "Sayaka? She had the kitchen knife?",
    73: "S-Sayaka!?",
    74: "Sayaka wanted to... on me?",
    75: "Just hold on! That can't be true!",
    76: "Because... because...",
    77: "There still might be one clue left, Sayaka's dying message.",
    78: "Her left index finger had blood on it.",
    79: "That could only be because she used that finger to write the message.",
    80: "Huh?",
    81: "Oh my god. Now I see! She wrote down the killer's name!",
    82: "The key to solving this mystery was simply to rotate the writing 180 degrees.",
    83: "If you turn the message around,",
    84: "It becomes the letters L-E-O-N.",
    85: "L-E-O-N, or more accurately, Leon.",
    86: "You mean, the burnt shirt piece I found laying on the ground by the incinerator, right?",
    87: "You're right. That alone isn't enough. But there are some other points that may reveal the truth.",
    88: "Yeah, I think so.",
    89: "If we look closely at how the shirt was disposed of, we should be able to figure out who the killer is.",
    90: "Hold on. I think I know how someone could dispose of the evidence without using the trash room key.",
    91: "Yes, you could, if you used this.",
    92: "The killer simply took aim at the incinerator switch and threw the ball through a gap in the gate.",
    93: "All they had to do was hit that switch, and the incinerator would come to life.",
    94: "Remember what you said before, Hifumi?",
    95: "Hifumi had the key, so the only way the incinerator could have been turned on without his knowledge...",
    96: "was because the killer was able to hit the switch without opening the gate.",
    97: "Once they'd gotten the incinerator going, all they had to do was ball up the shirt and toss it in.",
    98: "Difficult, absolutely. Impossible? I don't think so. Because the killer is...",
    99: "Because the killer is the ultimate baseball star. Isn't that right, Leon?",
    100: "Say what you want, Leon. But all the questions have been answered, and the truth has been revealed.",
    101: "Now here's what happened.",
    102: "I think I'd better take one more look back at the case from the beginning.",
    103: "Last night, the killer went to the room Sayaka was in. In other words, my room.",
    104: "From what we can tell, Sayaka invited that person there intending to kill them.",
    105: "She attacked them with the knife she'd taken from the kitchen earlier.",
    106: "But then something happened that she wasn't prepared for.",
    107: "They grabbed the fake sword I'd put in my room, and fought back.",
    108: "During the struggle, a strike from the sword broke Sayaka's right wrist.",
    109: "And that's when she lost her grip on the kitchen knife.",
    110: "Finding herself cornered, Sayaka panicked and ran into the bathroom.",
    111: "The killer went after her, but couldn't get the bathroom door open.",
    112: "What they didn't know was that my bathroom door got stuck easily, and there was a trick to opening it.",
    113: "Sayaka knew about that because I told her, but of course the killer had no way of knowing.",
    114: "So instead, the killer forced the door open, took the kitchen knife,",
    115: "And stabbed Sayaka.",
    116: "But with what strength she had remaining, Sayaka left a dying message.",
    117: "To keep the killer from noticing, she wrote it on the wall behind her.",
    118: "And with that, all her strength was gone.",
    119: "With Sayaka dead, the killer quickly began destroying the evidence.",
    120: "First they took off their shirt, which was covered in their victim's blood.",
    121: "Then they took the lint roller in my room and cleaned up the entire area.",
    122: "They wanted to make sure they got rid of any trace they'd ever been there.",
    123: "Afterwards, the killer headed to the trash room to destroy their bloody shirt.",
    124: "They tried to burn the shirt using the incinerator there.",
    125: "but the trash room was blocked off by an especially sturdy gate, preventing access to the incinerator.",
    126: "So they came up with a plan to use Hiro's crystal ball, which he'd left in the laundry room.",
    127: "The killer managed to throw the ball through the gap in the gate and hit the incinerator's switch.",
    128: "For any normal person, that'd be an impossible throw, but the killer had the confidence to take a shot.",
    129: "and that's because the killer was the ultimate baseball star.",
    130: "The crystal ball, thrown with absolute precision, hit the switch on the incinerator.",
    131: "which then quickly roared to life.",
    132: "Having destroyed the final piece of evidence, they left the area with, I imagine, a sigh of relief.",
    133: "But there was one thing they missed.",
    134: "Part of the shirt they'd thrown into the fire burnt away and fell out of the incinerator.",
    135: "The killer didn't notice this, and so left behind a piece of indisputable evidence.",
    136: "Isn't that right, Leon?",
    137: "It would appear that Hiro simply forgot his crystal ball in the laundry room.",
    138: "You went there to try and wash the blood out of your shirt, and that's where you saw it, right?",
    139: "Seeing the ball, you thought of a way to take care of everything.",
    140: "The screws on the bathroom doorknob were removed.",
    141: "I wonder what kind of tool the killer used to remove them.",
    142: "But the toolkit in my room had clearly never been used.",
    143: "Okay, then whose toolkit did the killer use?",
    144: "It had to be their very own toolkit.",
    145: "\"Leon, would you mind showing us your toolkit? If I'm right about this, then-\"",
    146: "The screwdriver will show some evidence of being used."

    metadata: { index: 146 },
    1: "Can we agree that the object that dealt the fatal blow was the dumbbell, found at the scene of the crime?",
    2: "It was covered in blood, and there was nothing else at the scene that could have caused that kind of injury.",
    3: "I might know one reason he could be involved.",
    4: "I found this file while I was looking around the archive in the library.",
    5: "I guess it's some kind of confidential file the police put together about the Genocide Jack case.",
    6: "Apparently, in every Genocide Jack case, the killer suspends the body in a certain way.",
    7: "Other than the killer, the only people who know about this are the higher-ups in the police department.",
    8: "Is it because Genocide Jack has a split personality?",
    9: "I think I read that somewhere in the file too.",
    10: "They thought that the suspect might have, what did they call it, dissociative identity disorder.",
    11: "You're talking about how she started acting totally different than usual, right?",
    12: "Then, it's not true?",
    13: "Are the methods of murder really exactly the same? I'm not so sure about that.",
    14: "I think there's a slight difference between the Genocide Jack cases and this one.",
    15: "Let me rephrase that in a way that maybe makes more sense.",
    16: "There are two clear differences between the Genocide Jack cases and this one.",
    17: "For one, the cause of death is different.",
    18: "In the Genocide Jack murders, all the victims were killed the same way.",
    19: "According to the case file, they were all apparently killed with... a pair of scissors.",
    20: "But Chihiro died from a blow to the head, right?",
    21: "Wouldn't it be strange for someone who kills the same way without fail to suddenly change their method?",
    22: "And there's more. One more conflicting detail.",
    23: "Do you remember what the killer used to suspend her?",
    24: "They'd use some kind of rope to hang her up by her wrists.",
    25: "Well, in all the previous Genocide Jack cases, something else was used to suspend them.",
    26: "Specifically, pairs of razor-sharp scissors.",
    27: "Big Mac, are you referring to me?",
    28: "Huh?",
    29: "Is it because Chihiro was a girl?",
    30: "In all the Genocide Jack cases, all the victims had something in common.",
    31: "Byakuya, it's possible you could have found out, isn't it?",
    32: "you'd have no problem gaining access to classified government documents or internal police records.",
    33: "Plus, you'd already looked through the genocide jack file before this all happened, hadn't you?",
    34: "Hmm... Looking back and thinking about it now...",
    35: "The way you were acting right before we discovered the body was a little strange.",
    36: "You wanted to go to the girls' locker room right away, right? But since you're a guy...",
    37: "On the contrary, there's something very strange.",
    38: "I'll tell you what's so strange about that.",
    39: "Because up until we actually discovered the body, we couldn't have known who the victim was.",
    40: "So your claim that you went to the girl's locker room first because Chihiro was the victim doesn't hold up.",
    41: "Huh?",
    42: "There is. I think.",
    43: "Actually, I'm pretty sure you HAVE seen it before.",
    44: "Because, you see, that rope, or should I say...",
    45: "That extension cord?",
    46: "Byakuya, you've used the extension cord in the library more than once, haven't you?",
    47: "And the same extension cord that was in the library all this time?",
    48: "went missing after the murder.",
    49: "And there's no way someone who uses that extension cord as much as you do wouldn't discover that fact.",
    50: "Um, sorry, but could we hold on just a second?",
    51: "I... I think we need to talk about this a little more.",
    52: "I know, but still.",
    53: "There's something that's still bothering me.",
    54: "You say you killed Chihiro in the girls' locker room, right?",
    55: "But are you sure about that? Isn't it possible that the murder took place somewhere else?",
    56: "Well, I think it's entirely possible that she was killed somewhere else, then carried there later.",
    57: "Along with the rest of the murder scene.",
    58: "I believe I do.",
    59: "The proof that she was killed somewhere else is the poster that's hanging in each locker room.",
    60: "The poster in the girls' locker room was...",
    61: "a picture of a big, boobed supermodel. But don't you think that's kind of strange?",
    62: "Why would the girls' locker room have a poster like that?",
    63: "Meanwhile, the boys' locker room had...",
    64: "A poster of the super popular boy band, Tornado.",
    65: "Again, that doesn't really seem to belong in a boy's locker room.",
    66: "And there's one other thing I noticed about the locker rooms.",
    67: "You know what I'm talking about. Right, Sakura?",
    68: "The stain on the girls' locker room carpet wasn't scrubbed away.",
    69: "In fact, I found it on the boys' locker room carpet.",
    70: "to move the murder scene from one locker room to the other. It's certainly plausible, don't you think?",
    71: "In other words, in order to completely swap the scene of the crime,",
    72: "The bloodstained poster and carpet were moved along with the dead body.",
    73: "By doing this, the killer was able to change the entire room where the murder took place.",
    74: "Huh?",
    75: "\"Ah!\"",
    76: "No, I don't think Chihiro used Leon's handbook.",
    77: "Because Leon's handbook was broken.",
    78: "The girl's locker room?",
    79: "What is it?",
    80: "Chihiro was... a guy?",
    81: "Well, without a doubt, Byakuya's the one that made Chihiro's death look like Genocide Jack did it.",
    82: "But... but I...",
    83: "I think he might not actually be the killer after all.",
    84: "He just seems to be too easy-going about all this, like he's enjoying us solving the mystery.",
    85: "The way he's acting, it makes it seem like it doesn't have anything to do with him.",
    86: "Plus, the evidence he left behind was a little too… how can I put it… overt.",
    87: "He consciously chose to use the extension cord, knowing it could connect him to the murder.",
    88: "At least, that's how I see it.",
    89: "And Byakuya, when you found out the murder took place in the boys' locker room, it seemed to rattle you.",
    90: "And then again when you found out Chihiro was actually a guy.",
    91: "If you really were the killer, that stuff wouldn't have had any effect on you.",
    92: "Well, I don't think I can say for sure without talking about it a little more.",
    93: "Anyway, let's discuss this all as a group one more time. We still have time to make our decision.",
    94: "I believe someone else did see the victim before he was murdered. What do you think, Celeste?",
    95: "but knowing what we know, I can't even guess.",
    96: "Huh?",
    97: "Hold on a second, Mondo. What did you just say?",
    98: "When Celeste testified a few minutes ago, she said-",
    99: "She never said anything about the jacket's color.",
    100: "So why did you say Chihiro's blue tracksuit?",
    101: "And before we began the trial, did you tell anyone that?",
    102: "No. That can't be it either. According to Celeste's testimony...",
    103: "When Celeste noticed it, Chihiro made a point of making sure the jacket was completely in the bag.",
    104: "If you just ran into him briefly, you couldn't possibly have seen what color the tracksuit was.",
    105: "But why? What made you so suspicious?",
    106: "Mondo? Was it really you?",
    107: "Did you really... kill Chihiro?",
    108: "That was fast.",
    109: "Oh yeah, that reminds me. Hifumi, weren't you telling me you'd found some evidence?",
    110: "We know Chihiro's handbook was missing from the scene of the crime, right?",
    111: "You already told us before that the handbook has one weak point, didn't you?",
    112: "You knew it?",
    113: "Anyway, if you found the victim's handbook in the sauna...",
    114: "then the killer must have been purposely trying to raise its temperature in order to break it.",
    115: "I might know someone who did.",
    116: "I think the one who may have taken their handbook into the sauna was...",
    117: "Mondo, your handbook got broken in the sauna, didn't it?",
    118: "Mondo and Taka had an endurance contest in the sauna not too long ago, remember?",
    119: "And for the contest, Mondo just so happened to keep his school uniform on.",
    120: "But little did he realize, he'd also left his handbook in one of his uniform pockets.",
    121: "And when it was all over, Mondo discovered that taking your handbook into the sauna could easily destroy it.",
    122: "Mondo, the handbook you have right now, is it really yours?",
    123: "The broken handbook that was in the main hall.",
    124: "Isn't that one actually yours?",
    125: "What I mean is, I think Mondo swapped his handbook out for one that actually works.",
    126: "I think he took Leon's handbook and replaced it with his own.",
    127: "After all, Monokuma said himself that Leon's handbook never should have broken.",
    128: "Well Mondo, if I'm wrong about this, you're welcome to say so.",
    129: "I'm happy to admit I made a mistake, but",
    130: "Okay, then why don't we look back on this case one more time, from the beginning.",
    131: "That way, everything will become clear, and we'll all see if I was right or wrong.",
    132: "First, let's take a look back to before the incident.",
    133: "Last night, Celeste saw Chihiro in the warehouse, correct?",
    134: "At the time, she was apparently stuffing something into a duffel bag.",
    135: "That something was a blue tracksuit. You can confirm this, right, Celeste?",
    136: "With bag in hand, Chihiro headed out, even though it was officially nighttime.",
    137: "She made her way to the locker room, specifically the boys' locker room.",
    138: "But how could the victim, who is apparently a girl, access the boys' locker room?",
    139: "Simple, because she was really a he.",
    140: "which is why he was able to use his own e-handbook to gain entrance to the boys' locker room.",
    141: "Once inside, he met with someone there, and the person he met was the one who killed him.",
    142: "It seems likely that the killer grabbed the nearby dumbbell, approached the unsuspecting Chihiro,",
    143: "and attacked him.",
    144: "And that's where the bloodstains on the poster and carpeting in the boys' locker room came from.",
    145: "It was likely in the heat of the moment. The body was arranged, but the murder itself felt unplanned.",
    146: "which is why the killer hurried to try and hide the act. First, pulling up the bloodstained carpet.",
    147: "Then, removing the bloody poster?",
    148: "and finally carrying the corpse into the girls' locker room.",
    149: "A girl's handbook was necessary to get into the locker room, of course.",
    150: "but this alone doesn't prove that the killer was necessarily a girl.",
    151: "After all, Sayaka and Junko's handbooks had been placed in the main hall.",
    152: "Using one of those, a boy could get into the girl's locker room without much problem.",
    153: "And that's exactly how the killer did it.",
    154: "With the carpet and the poster they'd brought with them, they got to work.",
    155: "they changed the layout of the boys' and girls' locker room in what you might call a crime scene switch.",
    156: "That could've been the end of things, but no.",
    157: "Byakuya discovered the body and decided to... ...intervene in the situation, making things even more complicated.",
    158: "So, after stumbling on the crime scene,",
    159: "He went and grabbed the extension cord from the library, and then he got to work.",
    160: "He used the cord to string up Chihiro's lifeless body.",
    161: "Then, using the victim's own blood, he left a grisly message there at the scene of the crime.",
    162: "He wanted to create the illusion that Genocide Jack was responsible for the slaughter.",
    163: "And around the same time that Byakuya was putting together this facade,",
    164: "The killer, having already disposed of Chihiro's bag and other belongings, arrived at the sauna,",
    165: "There, they plan to destroy the last piece of evidence. Chihiro's handbook.",
    166: "And just as the killer expected, the steamy sauna was enough to ruin the electronic gadget.",
    167: "Somehow, the killer knew that the handbook couldn't stand up to the heat of the sauna.",
    168: "And the reason they knew that is because the sauna had already wrecked their own handbook.",
    169: "And that's how it all played out.",
    170: "Isn't that right, Mondo Owada?",
    171: "If my thinking so far is right,",

    1: "Are we sure Hiro really made those blueprints?",
    2: "Well, take a look at this.",
    3: "It's the note that Hiro wrote, asking everyone to meet up after Alter Ego disappeared.",
    4: "The handwriting's obviously different, wouldn't you say?",
    5: "when you compare it to the blueprints.",
    6: "What?",
    7: "Other than Hiro, I can't think of anyone else it could have been.",
    8: "Obviously he was the one in that particular suit, and we never found any kind of second suit.",
    9: "They were a dolly and a tarp, right?",
    10: "So, let's see if I can explain.",
    11: "Taka's body disappeared from the equipment room. And then we rediscovered it in the repository.",
    12: "And when we found it for the second time, it was wrapped in a blue tarp, right?",
    13: "It was the same tarp that, up until then, was stored in the equipment room.",
    14: "So the killer must have seen it there, and decided to use it when they moved Taka's body.",
    15: "That way, they wouldn't leave any bloodstains while they were moving it.",
    16: "Same thing.",
    17: "I'm sure the dolly was in the equipment room when we first found Taka's body there.",
    18: "But when the body disappeared, so did the dolly.",
    19: "Later, when Taka's body reappeared in the repository,",
    20: "So did the dolly.",
    21: "Huh?",
    22: "If you're asking for proof that the dolly moved, I have it right here.",
    23: "When I found the dolly in the repository, one of the wheels had a blood stain on it.",
    24: "There was a pool of blood in the equipment room with a tire mark in it that matched the dolly wheel's tread.",
    25: "The killer probably rolled the dolly through the blood on accident, as they wheeled the body out of the room.",
    26: "and as the blood dried on the tire, they moved the body into the repository.",
    27: "So there's my proof that the dolly was used to move Taka's body.",
    28: "You're absolutely right that you could push a dolly without a handle if you stoop down low.",
    29: "But if you were wearing that suit, do you think you could actually get into a position like that?",
    30: "Think back to what you said when we were all checking out the suit together, remember?",
    31: "When you're in that suit, not only can you not see your feet, but you can't even bend at the waist.",
    32: "Am I right about that?",
    33: "When you can't even see your feet, you really think someone could kick the dolly all that way?",
    34: "\"I don't think taking off the suit was an option. If you remember-\"",
    35: "If he could have gotten it off by himself, I don't think he would have let us see him wearing it.",
    36: "Showing up in the suit was basically an invitation for everyone to suspect him.",
    37: "When Celeste told us that, we decided to split up and search the second floor.",
    38: "And soon after that,",
    39: "And then,",
    40: "At that point, we decided to divide up into two groups.",
    41: "Celeste, Hina, and I went back to the nurse's office.",
    42: "while Sakura, Byakuya, and Toko chased after the suspect.",
    43: "When we got back to the nurse's office, we found Hifumi. Dead.",
    44: "And that's when we heard the body discovery announcement.",
    45: "I left Celeste and Hina there and headed back to the third floor, to let the others know what had happened.",
    46: "And that's when I told you guys about Hifumi.",
    47: "Then the three of us headed for the nurse's office.",
    48: "but right after we left the physics lab?",
    49: "We ran into Celeste, who'd arrived after us, and she told us something very surprising.",
    50: "We rushed back to the nurse's office and saw that she was right.",
    51: "I think that about covers it.",
    52: "Okay, well, if that's true, then what?",
    53: "Hold on. There's no reason to assume that the hammers were used in the same order as their numbers.",
    54: "If anything, that's just another way the killer tried to disguise their actions.",
    55: "I've got it! Taka's wristwatch!",
    56: "See? Look! It broke with the hands pointing just past six o'clock.",
    57: "And that would be his official time of death.",
    58: "and before Celeste was attacked this morning, which happened around 7.",
    59: "That simple fact slipped past all of us.",
    60: "We made the wrong assumption about the order of events, all because of those justice hammers.",
    61: "Hmm... So what now, Kyoko?",
    62: "That's true. We searched everywhere, but we couldn't figure out how to explain his body disappearing.",
    63: "And according to what Celeste said,",
    64: "His body apparently disappeared in the one minute her and Hina took their eyes off of it.",
    65: "But to carry that much weight from the first floor up to the third in that short amount of time?",
    66: "Huh?",
    67: "Was the body discovery announcement that was made really intended for Hifumi?",
    68: "Maybe, but that was also the same time that Taka's body was found.",
    69: "So there's a good chance we've made a mistake in there somewhere.",
    70: "I think we've confused whether the announcement was for Hifumi or Taka.",
    71: "Exactly. We heard the body discovery announcement twice.",
    72: "We heard it a second time in the repository, when we rediscovered the two bodies.",
    73: "It didn't seem weird at the time, but it contradicts what Monokuma just told us, doesn't it?",
    74: "then in reality,",
    75: "When the two dead bodies were rediscovered, one of them was actually...",
    76: "being discovered for the first time!",
    77: "And that's just part of it.",
    78: "There's one other thing that leads me to believe he was still alive in the nurse's office.",
    79: "In fact, there was one clear difference between Hifumi and the nurse's office in the repository.",
    80: "His glasses.",
    81: "That fact alone proves that he was only playing dead in the beginning.",
    82: "When we found Hifumi in the nurse's office, his glasses were covered with blood.",
    83: "But when we found him again later in the repository...",
    84: "They were spotless.",
    85: "And I found the item he used to wipe them clean in the nurse's office trash can.",
    86: "It was a glasses cleaning cloth featuring a certain cartoon mascot.",
    87: "One look at the bloodstain on the cloth should make things clear.",
    88: "This piece of cloth was used to wipe Ifumi's glasses clean.",
    89: "And the mascot on the cloth is the same one that's on the digital camera, right?",
    90: "And whose digital camera was it? Kifumi's, of course.",
    91: "I highly doubt anyone but Hifumi would have brought something like this to school.",
    92: "Then there's no question. It belonged to Hifumi.",
    93: "What I'm saying is, the blood on his glasses was wiped away using his own glasses cleaning cloth.",
    94: "But who would benefit from a clean pair of glasses other than the glasses owner?",
    95: "It could only have been Hifumi.",
    96: "That also explains how the door to the repository got locked.",
    97: "And the repository door can only be locked from the inside.",
    98: "Which means, when Hina and Sakura got to the repository, someone was already inside.",
    99: "You're talking about the note Hifumi had hidden away, aren't you?",
    100: "That's right, we found it stuffed in his pants.",
    101: "Okay, well, forget about the pants for now. Take a look at what the note says.",
    102: "I see. Then this note isn't the same one Hiro got.",
    103: "In other words, the killer got in touch with another person besides Hiro.",
    104: "And that person could only have been...",
    105: "That's right! Taka!",
    106: "The killer used this note to dry out Taka and murder him.",
    107: "No, there absolutely is a connection.",
    108: "The note said to meet at 6 AM, which is the same time Taka was murdered.",
    109: "We've already proven that using his wristwatch.",
    110: "But there's more. Look where the note says to meet.",
    111: "The equipment room, right?",
    112: "So, Taka was murdered at both the time and place written in the note.",
    113: "I think that should be plenty to show that this note was definitely meant for Taka.",
    114: "Most likely, Hifumi stole it off Taka's corpse after he died.",
    115: "When I searched Taka's body, I saw that his lifeless hand was gripping a small scrap of paper.",
    116: "If I'm right about this, the sheet of paper this piece came from is-",
    117: "I knew it! It fits perfectly with the note we found hidden on Hifumi!",
    118: "Yup, they're from the same piece of paper.",
    119: "Sorry, no.",
    120: "When we found him in the repository, Hifumi was truly and completely dead.",
    121: "The second body discovery announcement proves that.",
    122: "Those were accounted for in other rooms too, and I don't think either one is big enough to kill someone.",
    123: "The murder weapon wasn't a justice hammer at all. No, it was something completely different.",
    124: "Specifically, a hammer from the repository. The killer could have easily used that to kill Hifumi.",
    125: "Now, all the hammers in the repository were covered in flecks of grit and debris.",
    126: "but for some reason, one of them had been scrubbed clean.",
    127: "And the reason it had been scrubbed clean was most likely because it was used to commit murder.",
    128: "If the hammer got covered in Hifumi's blood, of course they'd have to clean it off.",
    129: "I'd also like to point out that the repository has all kinds of hammers, big ones, small ones,",
    130: "And even some flat mallet-like ones.",
    131: "I think whoever made the Justice Hammers used those as a basis for their design.",
    132: "Since there were two murders, it's at least plausible that more than one person was involved.",
    133: "Risk versus reward benefit.",
    134: "So in this case, there wasn't one single person committing multiple murders.",
    135: "Instead, each person killed someone, creating two separate incidents.",
    136: "And it only looked like one person because that's how the true killer designed it to look.",
    137: "A single suspicious individual, a similar weapon used in each crime, disappearing bodies.",
    138: "By creating one seamless set of circumstances, they made it look like one person was behind it all.",
    139: "It was Celeste!",
    140: "The behavior they had in common has to do with the suspicious individual in the suit, doesn't it?",
    141: "The only ones who ever actually saw Robo-Justice firsthand were Celeste and Hifumi.",
    142: "\"S-sorry.\"",
    143: "I just realized another strange thing.",
    144: "When we found Hifumi in the nurse's office, who we now know was only pretending to be dead,",
    145: "\"Celeste, you were the first one to say he'd been murdered.\"",
    146: "You wanted to make sure we wouldn't have any doubt in our minds.",
    147: "Hina, you were with Celeste when Hifumi's body disappeared, right?",
    148: "She wasn't worried about you. She just saw a chance to help Hifumi sneak out of the nurse's office.",
    149: "That's right. There's no reason Celeste should have said, Just like those guys died.",
    150: "When she said that, none of us had told her Taka was dead.",
    151: "So how did you know, Celeste?",
    152: "How did you know more than one person had been killed? And how did you know they were both guys?",
    153: "Because Kyoko had also disappeared, right? So she could have been dead too.",
    154: "It's not a picture of the suspect dragging Hifumi away.",
    155: "I would say it's a picture of Hifumi dragging the suspect away.",
    156: "No. Even if the person inside the suit were unconscious, they could still stand up like that.",
    157: "Because that Robo-Justice suit had a certain characteristic.",
    158: "Celeste and Hifumi took the suit they'd specially designed and stuffed Hiro into it.",
    159: "That's how they were able to fake that whole thing.",
    160: "The point of it all was to make us believe whoever was in the suit was to blame.",
    161: "Kyoko, what do you mean by that?",
    162: "That's right. Our last names. He called us all by our last names.",
    163: "So, Hifumi was trying to tell us the last name of whoever killed him?",
    164: "\"Well, no. Hold on. There's one person it could apply to.\"",
    165: "And that's Celeste. She never actually told us what her real name is.",
    166: "Okay, then fill us in. What's your real name?",
    167: "That's it! The handbook!",
    168: "Anytime you turn your handbook on, it shows the owner's name when it boots up, right?",
    169: "Monokuma told us all about it before.",
    170: "So all we have to do is check her handbook, and that'll clear up everything.",
    171: "That's how we can find out Celeste's real name!",
    172: "Celeste.",
    173: "Can you please just tell us what really happened?",
    174: "Please, just tell us.",
    175: "Fine then. Let me settle it.",
    176: "Let me go over the case again, from the beginning, and shed light on all your crimes.",
    177: "And that'll bring everything to an end.",
    178: "Before anything, the killer persuaded someone to help carry out the murder. And that person was...",
    179: "Hifumi. Within Accomplice, the killer was able to execute a number of otherwise impossible schemes.",
    180: "First, they convinced someone to meet them in the rec room, last night at 1 in the morning.",
    181: "That someone they met with was Hiro.",
    182: "The murderous duo intended to pass Hiro off as the prime suspect, so when they met up with him...",
    183: "They drugged him, knocked him out, and stuffed him into the robo-justice suit.",
    184: "Next, Hifumi positioned himself to make it look like Robo Justice was attacking him.",
    185: "while the killer used a digital camera to take pictures of the assault.",
    186: "They did all this just to create evidence that would put the suspicion on Hiro.",
    187: "When they were done with him, they shoved him, still unconscious, into the pool room locker.",
    188: "And then finally, at 6am, they moved into the murder phase of their plan.",
    189: "they called Taka to the equipment room.",
    190: "And that's where Hifumi killed him, making it the scene of the first murder.",
    191: "The murder weapon was Justice Hammer 4, which was left there in the equipment room.",
    192: "The reason hammer number four was used was to create confusion about the order of the crimes.",
    193: "So, next they falsified two more assault incidents.",
    194: "For these attacks, the killers pretended to be the victims, to solidify robo-justice as the suspect.",
    195: "The first fake incident was the attack in the rec room.",
    196: "There, the killers wanted us to see Justice Hammer 1, and the Robo-Justice pictures they'd taken.",
    197: "They wanted to make sure we bought the surprise attack story.",
    198: "The second fake incident was the attack in the library.",
    199: "This time, they planted Justice Hammer 2, and an injured Hifumi, to sell us that story.",
    200: "With these two incidents, the killers were able to create a certain preconception in our minds.",
    201: "that the suspect was increasing the size of the hammers and attacking people in order as they did.",
    202: "We fell right into their trap and started looking for the suspect based on that, but",
    203: "While we did that, we left Hifumi alone in the nurse's office.",
    204: "This was exactly what Hifumi was hoping for.",
    205: "He took a blood packet from the refrigerator, and Justice Hammer 3?",
    206: "and turned the room into a crime scene, in which he himself had apparently been brutally murdered.",
    207: "He let out a scream to draw us back, and when we returned, that's what we found.",
    208: "Meanwhile, the other group that had been out searching found Taka's body at the same time,",
    209: "So when we heard the body discovery announcement, we naturally assumed it was for Hifumi.",
    210: "We left the nurse's office, and Hifumi once again took advantage of the situation.",
    211: "He simply got up and made his escape.",
    212: "When we learned his body had disappeared, we all rushed back to the nurse's office.",
    213: "And once again, Hifumi had the chance he was waiting for. This time, he snuck into the equipment room.",
    214: "He wrapped Taka's body in a tarp and used the dolly to move it all the way down to the repository.",
    215: "That explains how each of the bodies disappeared.",
    216: "But even Hifumi didn't know what the true killer had in mind for their final act.",
    217: "Their plan all along was to kill Hifumi and get rid of the one person who could betray them.",
    218: "And they did it using an ordinary, everyday hammer from the repository.",
    219: "That should cover everything that happened in this case. And the villain behind it all is...",
    220: "Celeste! Sorry, you lose.",
    221: "Then you admit it? You're the killer?",
    222: "Taiko?"

  [Chapter.Chapter_4]: {
    metadata: { index: 543 },
    1: "Another reason you suspect them is because Sakura wanted to meet with them, right?",
    2: "Hiro, when we were talking before, you dropped a small piece of paper, remember?",
    3: "It was white with red polka dots.",
    4: "In that case, Hiro, where did you get that piece of candy?",
    5: "The last time you saw Sakura was when Hina had to go to the nurse's office, right?",
    6: "I'm not sure about that, Hiro.",
    7: "Hina didn't actually give Sakura the candy till after she left the nurse's office.",
    8: "So if that was the last time you saw her, there's no reason you should have had that candy.",
    9: "Kyoko, you found the magazine on the magazine shelf, right?",
    10: "If that's true, then what Hiro just said doesn't really make sense, does it?",
    11: "When Sakura's body was found, that magazine was sitting on the shelf nearby.",
    12: "That's where Kyoko found it, after we'd begun the investigation.",
    13: "And you weren't at the murder scene, so there's no way you could have seen it then.",
    14: "Tell us the truth, Hiro. When did you see the message?",
    15: "I'm completely unconvinced that Sakura wrote that dying message.",
    16: "Because if you look at it, the message was almost certainly written using a finger, but",
    17: "Both of her hands were completely free of blood.",
    18: "But why would you write something like that?",
    19: "That's true. Everything you just said. It doesn't explain why the magazine was hidden, does it?",
    20: "By the time the body was discovered, the magazine had been picked up and put on the shelf.",
    21: "Why would you take the time to write that message, then stick it somewhere we might not find it?",
    22: "Really?",
    23: "It had to be Toko, right?",
    24: "Who else would want to hide the magazine other than the person whose name was written on it?",
    25: "No, you didn't.",
    26: "I don't doubt Hiro attacks Sakura with the bottle, but that's not where this case ends.",
    27: "If Sakura died from Hiro's single blow, that doesn't explain why she had two head wounds.",
    28: "That was the bottle Hiro hit Sakura with, right?",
    29: "That's it. The chess pieces.",
    30: "Inside each bottle, there was a Monokuma figure holding a different chess piece.",
    31: "And the piece that was inside the broken bottle we found was...",
    32: "The night, if I remember.",
    33: "So we only have evidence for five bottles at the scene, while one apparently went missing.",
    34: "The bottle must have been broken.",
    35: "Because there was evidence at the scene that supports it.",
    36: "Thank you.",
    37: "That's right. We found evidence that shows there was more than just one broken bottle at the scene.",
    38: "Earlier, Kyoko and I did a little experiment.",
    39: "We compared the weight of the broken bottle pieces at the scene to one of the unbroken bottles.",
    40: "And what we found was that the collection of pieces was heavier. And the reason for that is...",
    41: "there was actually more than one bottle's worth of shattered glass.",
    42: "Because of what it would reveal about the case.",
    43: "The bottle that was removed from the scene was used the second time Sakura was attacked.",
    44: "The killer wanted to make it look like there was only one attack, so they had to get rid of their evidence.",
    45: "Did you know someone left a handprint behind on the inside of the locker?",
    46: "They must have been hiding in there and put their hand on the wall without thinking.",
    47: "Does this handprint look familiar, Toko?",
    48: "but when you did, you put it back upside down.",
    49: "We found Sakura sitting upright in a chair.",
    50: "If the blow by the shelf was the cause of death, there's no explanation why she was in that chair.",
    51: "Sakura was definitely attacked in front of the shelf.",
    52: "The bloodstain by the magazines is proof of that.",
    53: "No, I don't think that's possible.",
    54: "Even before we opened the door to the rec room, Hina and I both got a look inside.",
    55: "And at that point, the locker was already open.",
    56: "So obviously, Toko couldn't have been hiding in there.",
    57: "According to the Monokuma file, Sakura had vomited blood.",
    58: "I think we can assume there's a chance this was related to her cause of death.",
    59: "In fact, there was even a trace of blood left around her mouth.",
    60: "The poison was actually in Section A, wasn't it?",
    61: "- Protein?",
    62: "Huh?",
    63: "The poison must have been poured into the protein can.",
    64: "If the protein's in the poison bottle, it seems only logical to assume the reverse is true, right?",
    65: "You're saying they gave her a protein drink, right?",
    66: "the footprints left behind in front of the shelf.",
    67: "That's the evidence you're talking about, isn't it?",
    68: "Ah, Hina?",
    69: "\"Me and Hina are the only ones. Oh, so Byakuya. That explains why you-\"",
    70: "Definitely not.",
    71: "I... I can't believe it!",
    72: "Well, it's just, the two of them were so close.",
    73: "Hina, is it true?",
    74: "\"Did you really... kill Sakura? And if you did...\"",
    75: "Why? Why would you do that?",
    76: "Are you talking about the locked room problem?",
    77: "Are you sure about that?",
    78: "Even ignoring the fact that I don't want to believe it, it just doesn't fit.",
    79: "I mean, why would someone leave such a clear clue like a footprint?",
    80: "It's too obvious, too easy.",
    81: "Hina, please, I'd like to know too.",
    82: "That story you just told.",
    83: "First you went to Section C to get the poison. Then moved to Section A to get the protein, right?",
    84: "meaning you went from Section C to Section A. Do I have that correct?",
    85: "Can you repeat that series of events one more time?",
    86: "You said you went to get the poison from Section C, and that's where you spilled the powder, right?",
    87: "And after that, you said you moved from Section C to Section A to get the protein.",
    88: "But the footprints left at the scene were not moving from Section C to Section A.",
    89: "That contradicts what you just said.",
    90: "No, that can't be it. Remember what Hina just said?",
    91: "Huh? Me?",
    92: "It's part of the window from the rec room door, right?",
    93: "The window we broke to get in was light blue, just like that. So I think that must be it.",
    94: "What's strange is that, according to what Hina told us,",
    95: "The bottle of poison was left on the shelf in the chem lab. That is what you said, right, Hina?",
    96: "And yet, somehow a piece of glass from the rec room window made its way into the bottle.",
    97: "In reality, that bottle of poison most definitely found its way to the rec room.",
    98: "It was there at least until the window got broken. In other words, when the locked room was unlocked.",
    99: "There's no other way to explain the presence of that glass in that bottle.",
    100: "Yeah, me either.",
    101: "You remember how there was broken glass scattered all around the room, right?",
    102: "Well, those pieces weren't just scattered around the protein can.",
    103: "We also found pieces underneath the can.",
    104: "And this proves it.",
    105: "It shows that the can must have been put down on the floor after the window was broken.",
    106: "So it had to be after we got into the room!",
    107: "So you asked everyone about it to eliminate that possibility right out of the gate.",
    108: "No, that's not why.",
    109: "The only explanation is, she drank it from its original bottle, knowing exactly what it was.",
    110: "I think it was Sakura herself.",
    111: "Hina, did you know that Sakura's foot had a certain yellow powder stuck to it?",
    112: "It did. The same yellow powder that had been spilled by the shelf in the chem lab.",
    113: "That powder was yellow, wasn't it?",
    114: "So the powder we found on Sakura, what else could it be but the powder from the chem lab?",
    115: "Sakura must have been standing right there where the powder was spilled.",
    116: "So the person who spilled the powder by the shelf wasn't Hina, but Sakura.",
    117: "And when Sakura dropped the bottle, she dropped it away from where she was actually standing.",
    118: "which is how she was able to avoid getting it all over herself.",
    119: "But the powder still got scattered around, and some of it must have wound up on her instep.",
    120: "Is there any problem with my thinking?",
    121: "No, you didn't kill her.",
    122: "The one who killed Sakura, was Sakura herself.",
    123: "I can't believe it either, or rather, I don't want to believe it.",
    124: "But when you really think about it, everything matches up.",
    125: "Sakura went and got the poison. She barricaded herself in a room, and she drank it.",
    126: "all so she could end her own life.",
    127: "And that explains why we couldn't solve the mystery of the locked room.",
    128: "The locked room mystery was created by Sakura.",
    129: "That's when you picked up the bottle, right?",
    130: "I was too shocked to notice anything, and Kyoko was busy checking the body.",
    131: "When you were done, you gathered everyone together, and once you were back in the rec room...",
    132: "While everyone else was focused on Sakura, you quietly placed the can on the ground.",
    133: "Honestly, I should have noticed.",
    134: "You should've been the first one to run up to Sakura's lifeless body.",
    135: "The Hina I know never would have left her side in a situation like that.",
    136: "That's enough, Hina. It's over.",
    137: "It is.",
    138: "Actually, no. You're right.",
    139: "We have to end this properly.",
    140: "This case began when Sakura asked a number of people to meet her in the rec room.",
    141: "Specifically, those people were Hiro, Toko, and Byakuya.",
    142: "but one of them headed out a bit earlier than the others. Toko.",
    143: "She got there one step ahead of everyone else and looked around for a good hiding spot.",
    144: "And she found it. She crawled into the locker to get out of sight.",
    145: "Then, from inside the locker, she saw Sakura enter the room.",
    146: "Next to arrive was Hiro.",
    147: "When he got there, he mistakenly thought Sakura was going to try to kill him, so he panicked.",
    148: "Without thinking, he grabbed a nearby Monokuma bottle and attacked Sakura with it.",
    149: "Thinking he'd killed her, he hastily began covering up his crime.",
    150: "He took a magazine from the table and forged a dying message from Sakura.",
    151: "To that end, he wrote down a name.",
    152: "Toko. By writing her name, he was hoping to pin the murder on her.",
    153: "But of course, Toko had witnessed the whole thing. So as soon as the coast was clear,",
    154: "She jumped out of the locker and hid the magazine on the shelf with all the others.",
    155: "But in her rush, she made one little mistake.",
    156: "She put the magazine back upside down.",
    157: "Soon after, she watched as Sakura slowly opened her eyes.",
    158: "She also saw the blood dripping off Sakura's head and fainted.",
    159: "This caused her personality to switch back over to Genocide Jack.",
    160: "When she woke back up, her second personality also saw the blood-soaked Sakura.",
    161: "And she freaked out.",
    162: "And just like Hiro, she grabbed another Monokuma bottle and attacked her.",
    163: "This explains why there were two wounds on Sakura's head.",
    164: "Assuming Sakura really was dead this time, she set about disposing of the evidence.",
    165: "She gathered up the broken Monokuma bottle shards and the queen chess piece.",
    166: "And that explains how Sakura was attacked twice with the same type of weapon.",
    167: "But even after those two blows, she was still alive.",
    168: "So then, what was Sakura's actual cause of death?",
    169: "It was the poison that Sokka herself got from the chem lab.",
    170: "She turned the rec room into a true locked room scenario, and then drank the deadly mixture.",
    171: "And there, she took her final breath.",
    172: "Later on, the rest of us discovered that her body was in there.",
    173: "We had to smash the door's window to get inside.",
    174: "But someone already knew what had happened. Knew that she had committed suicide.",
    175: "And that same someone quietly snatched the bottle of poison from off the ground.",
    176: "And while nobody was looking, replaced it with an empty protein can.",
    177: "They did all this specifically to place all the suspicion on themselves.",
    178: "in an attempt to guide the trial to a false conclusion.",
    179: "And the one who went to all that effort?",
    180: "Was you, Hina.",
    181: "That's the full truth of the case.",
    182: "Sakura took her own life.",
    183: "and you claim to be the killer to hide that fact. Isn't that right?",
    184: "Huh? Oh, well, I mean..."

  [Chapter.Chapter_5]: {
    metadata: { index: 727 },
    1: "Um, okay. So I just have to prove that the corpse isn't Kyoko, right?",
    2: "Then let's compare Kyoko's traits to the traits of the dead body.",
    3: "I'm talking about her gloves. They'll give us some insight into the mystery. I'm sure of it.",
    4: "No. There's no way the corpse was wearing gloves.",
    5: "Whoever it was, they were wearing fake nails, remember?",
    6: "I imagine trying to wear gloves over nails like that would have been a pretty big pain.",
    7: "Besides, Kyoko wears gloves to hide her hands, right?",
    8: "It'd be pretty weird for someone who's self-conscious about their hands to wear fake nails, don't you think?",
    9: "Then that's that. The dead body doesn't belong to Kyoko.",
    10: "There was one clue left behind that we can use to identify the body.",
    11: "The key to figuring out who it was.",
    12: "is the tattoo on the back of her hand.",
    13: "The Fenrir Mercenary Corps. That's the name of the military group Mukuro Ikusaba belonged to.",
    14: "The representation of Fenrir is... a wolf.",
    15: "Exactly. The body we found had a tattoo of a wolf.",
    16: "which means that person must have once belonged to Fenrir.",
    17: "So it must have been Mukuro.",
    18: "You've narrowed it down to Kyoko and me, right?",
    19: "Um, I have something I'd like to say regarding the whole alibi thing.",
    20: "Well, before that, I just want to try and get a better idea of what time the murder took place.",
    21: "Doing that might reveal some kind of clue.",
    22: "The body must have been discovered at 9am, since that's when Toko went to get the pickaxe.",
    23: "For me, I was already asleep before nighttime hit, so I don't have an alibi after 10 o'clock.",
    24: "but I'm sure I met up with everyone else before nine this morning.",
    25: "Actually, the murder couldn't have happened anywhere near 10 o'clock. It had to have taken place way later.",
    26: "Because of the sprinklers in the garden.",
    27: "The sprinklers are set to go off right at 7.30 every morning, right?",
    28: "So if the body had been in the garden before 7:30...",
    29: "Then it should've been completely soaked!",
    30: "Sorry, Toko, but you're wrong.",
    31: "No, I'm saying that the body was wet, but not because of the sprinklers.",
    32: "Just remember what the body was like after the explosion, and you'll see why it wasn't the sprinklers.",
    33: "The top half of the body was wet, yes, but the bottom half was completely dry.",
    34: "If the sprinklers got the body wet, shouldn't the whole body have been wet?",
    35: "Let's just move on.",
    36: "The reason only the top half was wet was because...",
    37: "While the body was still on fire, I doused it with water. But only the part on fire, the top half.",
    38: "So if the sprinklers didn't get the body wet, then the murder must have taken place!",
    39: "Sometime after the sprinklers turned on at 7.30 in the morning.",
    40: "Huh? She did?",
    41: "Huh?",
    42: "What are you...",
    43: "You're talking about the tarp, aren't you?",
    44: "Wait, something's not right.",
    45: "But the underside of the tarp?",
    46: "It was totally spotless, right?",
    47: "Actually, one side being clean is pretty strange if you think about it.",
    48: "Because the blood wasn't dry before the body got blown up, right?",
    49: "Byakuya said it himself, not to touch it or you might get some on you.",
    50: "If you put a tarp on a body in that state, it absolutely would have gotten blood on it.",
    51: "Could it have been... chicken blood?",
    52: "When I checked the chicken coop before the murder, there were five chickens.",
    53: "But after the murder, there were only four.",
    54: "They covered it beforehand?",
    55: "Um, I think so.",
    56: "Wait, no! The head was through the neck hole, but the arms weren't in the sleeves!",
    57: "Huh?",
    58: "Maybe, but still.",
    59: "That's not...",
    60: "*Sigh*",
    61: "Yeah.",
    62: "It's not that I hid it. It's just...",
    63: "Just because I had the knife once...",
    64: "That automatically makes me the killer?",
    65: "Wait, hold on. The stab wound isn't what killed Mukuro.",
    66: "That should be clear from the description of the cover-up we just heard.",
    67: "No, don't you remember?",
    68: "The killer covered the dead body with the tarp, and then put the bloody coat on it,",
    69: "In other words, the victim never wore that bloodstained coat until after they were dead.",
    70: "So, when we discovered the body,",
    71: "The knife had been thrust through the coat, along with the body.",
    72: "Meaning, if she wasn't stabbed until the coat was put on, and she was already dead at that point,",
    73: "Obviously, the stab wound isn't what killed her.",
    74: "The Monokuma file clearly states that there was only one stab wound.",
    75: "was just another piece of camouflage set up by the true killer.",
    76: "they probably stabbed her to draw attention away from what actually killed her.",
    77: "Exploding the body afterward was probably meant to do the same thing.",
    78: "The explosion severely damaged the body, making it impossible to know what really killed her.",
    79: "It was all the killer's attempt to destroy all evidence of their crime.",
    80: "After the explosion, we found a tiny fragment of something on the ground near the body, right?",
    81: "That fragment reveals the cause of the explosion.",
    82: "That's only natural, because of course.",
    83: "We saw the same thing when we dismantled Monokuma.",
    84: "It's part of a bomb.",
    85: "Hold on a second, Byakuya.",
    86: "Well, I just feel like...we need to think this through. We still don't know what actually killed the victim.",
    87: "Mukuro died because of the blow to the back of the head she suffered.",
    88: "The Monokuma file makes it clear that those weren't fresh wounds.",
    89: "Mukuro was hit in the back of the head with something, and that's what killed her.",
    90: "And that something was the titanium arrow we found in the locker in the dojo.",
    91: "You're right. Just the one arrow would have been too weak. That's why the killer used another weapon.",
    92: "Inside the dojo locker, we also found a balled-up wad of duct tape.",
    93: "The killer probably used this duct tape to bind multiple arrows together.",
    94: "Bundling them together using the duct tape would easily create a single weapon as thick as a pipe.",
    95: "And that's exactly what the killer did.",
    96: "Oh, um...",
    97: "Of course I remember.",
    98: "The one thing that proves Kyoko was in the dojo is...",
    99: "Right here. The key to the dojo locker.",
    100: "Because I found it in your room.",
    101: "Hold on a second.",
    102: "No, it's not that I want to defend her. It's just...",
    103: "There's one more thing I need to ask her.",
    104: "Kyoko, I want you to tell me something.",
    105: "Last night, you were in my room, weren't you?",
    106: "Why? What were you doing there?",
    107: "That's what I need to know.",
    108: "What?",
    109: "If I'm right, Kyoko wouldn't have been able to get into her room.",
    110: "Because she had given her room key to Byakuya.",
    111: "What?",
    112: "Wait a second. You've got it all wrong.",
    113: "Let's think about it one more time. There's gotta be a hidden side to this case.",
    114: "\"First of all, there's something off about this entire trial. You all see it, don't you?\"",
    115: "Lucero, who we didn't even know existed, suddenly shows up dead, and then we're thrown into a trial!",
    116: "And Kyoko even said it's a trap the Mastermind set for us. So that's why this has to be...",
    117: "Huh?",
    118: "What? Time's up?",
    119: "Voting time?",
    120: "Hey, hold on!",
    121: "There was a lie hidden within Kyoko's statement just now.",
    122: "Isn't that right, Kyoko?",
    123: "No, Kyoko could have gotten into a room.",
    124: "You said so yourself, didn't you, Kyoko?",
    125: "Kyoko stole it from the headmaster's room. It lets you get into any room in the school.",
    126: "Which means, she could have used it to get into her own room.",
    127: "Huh?",
    128: "Then are you saying you really didn't?",
    129: "Kyoko, you really-",
    130: "Aren't the killer?",
    131: "Huh?",
    132: "But that's ridiculous! Since when is there any-",
    133: "No! This isn't right!"

    31: "And this isn't like some normal kind of memory loss.",
    32: "You stole those specific memories from us, didn't you?",
    33: "You mean the motive you came up with to try and get us to all kill each other?",
    34: "There's no question that the mastermind is somewhere within the school.",
    35: "In the back of the data center, I found a panel that controls Monokuma.",
    36: "The Mastermind must have been using that to control him all this time.",
    37: "So there can't be any doubt. The mastermind has been inside the school all along.",
    38: "What? Why me?",
    39: "Wait! What are you trying to say?",
    40: "All of the wounds covering her body. That's what really killed her.",
    41: "Consider this. What if the murder itself took place at least a few days ago?",
    42: "No, Mukuro didn't suffer those wounds in battle.",
    43: "The file we found in the headmaster's room said as much.",
    44: "Despite the time she spent in battle after battle as a member of Fenrir,",
    45: "When she entered this school, she hadn't sustained a single injury.",
    46: "Anyway, so we can be sure that Mukuro suffered all those wounds after coming to this school.",
    47: "In which case, they could be the very thing that killed her.",
    48: "Unless anyone has any better suggestions, I think we can say this with confidence.",
    49: "The wounds Mukuro sustained all over her body are what ultimately killed her.",
    50: "That's exactly what it means.",
    51: "When we found her body in the garden, she'd already been dead for several days.",
    52: "The one who attacked me was the true mastermind.",
    53: "when we discovered Mukuro in the garden wearing the same mask.",
    54: "I naturally assumed she must have been the one who attacked me.",
    55: "But I was wrong.",
    56: "It wasn't her at all. It was the Mastermind!",
    57: "Mukuro had a tattoo on her right hand, if I remember correctly.",
    58: "A representation of Fenrir. In other words, a wolf tattoo.",
    59: "But I saw the right hand of the person who attacked me.",
    60: "And there was no such tattoo.",

    62: "I thought you didn't want anyone to see those scars.",
    63: "No, not at all. I'm positive.",
    64: "Mukuro's body was probably kept hidden in the bio lab.",
    65: "That's right. It's actually set up for use as a morgue.",
    66: "So it's the perfect place to hide a body, and it'd keep the body preserved at the same time.",
    67: "and I have no doubt that that's exactly what happened. In fact, I have proof.",
    68: "What makes me so sure the body was carried from the bio lab to the garden is...",
    69: "The tarp that we found in the garden.",
    70: "When I was checking it over again, I noticed something.",
    71: "I noticed that some text had been stamped on one corner of the tarp.",
    72: "This proves that the tarp originally came from the bio lab.",
    73: "In fact, there's a whole stack of tarps just like it in there.",
    74: "What one thing?",
    75: "Why are you bringing that up now?",
    76: "Stop talking about that!",
    77: "The inconsistency Kyoko's talking about is... Blights!",
    78: "Like I said before, the Biolab also acts as a morgue.",
    79: "And as part of that, a giant refrigerator was installed in there.",
    80: "That's where everyone who's died is stored.",
    81: "But I counted up the number of blue lights that were on, including the one Mukuro was in.",
    82: "And there were only nine.",
    83: "Ten of the lights should have been on. Any other number is incredibly suspicious.",
    84: "That's right. Any other number should make you immediately suspicious.",
    85: "But according to the lights in the bio lab, only nine people were being stored there.",
    86: "But if they wanted to do that, they would have destroyed Mukuro's body, since they actually killed her.",
    87: "And yet, her body was left alone.",
    88: "What about if... the same person was killed twice?",
    89: "Officially, ten murders have been committed so far.",
    90: "But one of the victims may have been murdered, and then murdered again.",
    91: "If that's the case, there could have been ten killings, but still only nine victims, right?",
    92: "Junko.",
    93: "Wasn't her fatal injury pretty similar to Mukro's?",
    94: "Well, remember what happened to her?",
    95: "She was impaled by a bunch of spears all over her body.",
    96: "It all matches up, right? Those wounds Junko suffered could easily be these same injuries.",
    97: "No. The body we found in the garden was Mukuro. That's one thing we can be sure of.",
    98: "The body's appearance and measurements are consistent with her records.",
    99: "Right, Kyoko?",
    100: "And then there's the matter of the Fenrir tattoo. So there's no question it's her.",
    101: "Junko is still alive. It's the only possibility.",
    102: "Huh?",
    103: "She was dead. There's no question. Junko was dead.",
    104: "It must be... wrong.",
    105: "No, of course not. There's no way I'd give up that easy.",
    106: "That's it! What if she switched places with someone else?",
    107: "That's right. Before the spears could kill her, she got someone to take her place.",
    108: "Specifically, Mukuro Ikusaba!",
    109: "Which is why the body's height and weight and everything match Mukuro's profile, right?",
    110: "The two of them may have switched places from the very beginning.",
    111: "Yes, from the moment we first met.",
    112: "If that's when they switched,",
    113: "Then they wouldn't have had to switch at the moment of death, right?",
    114: "After all, the one we saw at that point would have already been Mukuro.",
    115: "So Mukuro, the ultimate despair, teamed up with someone like her.",
    116: "In other words, it would be fair to say that Junko herself was also the ultimate despair!",
    117: "Then why did you try and protect Junko's real identity?",
    118: "while I was in the AV room, watching the DVD of our interviews with the headmaster.",
    119: "You made sure I couldn't finish watching the video. And the reason you did that...",
    120: "Is because you didn't want me to see the real Junko, did you?",
    121: "The video wasn't the only thing you tried to cover up. You did the same thing with this group photo.",
    122: "I noticed it just a little while ago, when we were all comparing the photos we'd gotten.",
    123: "In all the photos, there's a certain similarity, an unusual circumstance.",
    124: "Junko's face.",
    125: "The one thing common to every single photo is that you can't see her face.",
    126: "It's hard to believe her face would just happen to be hidden in every single picture, don't you think?",
    127: "And on top of that, in this photo, you can see that Mukoro is clearly visible.",
    128: "So in other words, at that point, the two of them hadn't switched yet.",
    129: "With all that in mind, there's no doubt that the girl whose face is hidden here is the real Junko.",
    130: "Which is why you had to have pictures that didn't show her face.",
    131: "Because if we could have seen her face, then it would have clearly revealed.",
    132: "That the Junko in the pictures wasn't the Junko that we knew.",
    133: "And she's the one behind this whole murderous situation. This killing game.",
    134: "She's the true mastermind, and the ultimate despair!",
    135: "Don't bother trying to deny it.",
    136: "There's no more room for debate. You don't have anywhere left to run.",
    137: "I'll prove everything, right now!",
    138: "We met the ultimate fashionista, Junko Enoshima, right after we all arrived here.",
    139: "but that wasn't the real Junko.",
    140: "The girl we saw before us was actually the 16th student who had taken Junko's place.",
    141: "And that girl's name was Mukoro Ikusaba.",
    142: "But it wasn't long before she died at the hands of Monokuma. In other words, the Mastermind?",
    143: "\"Junko and Oshima!\"",
    144: "Her body was kept in a biolab, which had been converted into a morgue.",
    145: "until Junko decided to put her body to use.",
    146: "Junko dragged the body out of the biolab, using the tarp to carry her to the garden.",
    147: "She fabricated the murder to try and frame Kyoko, who'd proven to be one big thorn in her side.",
    148: "Meanwhile, she wanted us all to think Mukuro was still alive and hiding somewhere inside the school.",
    149: "So she put on a mask and then attacked me.",
    150: "After making sure I'd gotten a good look at the mask, she left the room.",
    151: "Then she put the same mask on Mukuro's body.",
    152: "This was all to make us think the person who attacked me and the corpse were one in the same.",
    153: "She wanted us to believe the murder had only recently taken place.",
    154: "Finally, by strapping a bomb to the body, she was able to destroy any remaining evidence.",
    155: "She needed to hide the body's true identity.",
    156: "She had to make sure we didn't find out it was actually the same person we'd met in the beginning.",
    157: "This is the truth behind Mukuro's murder.",
    158: "And the one who carried it all out is the true mastermind. The one controlling Monokuma.",
    159: "The real Junko Enoshima!",
    160: "That's the whole story behind this incident. Well, what do you have to say to that?",
    161: "\"That's right! It was before I ever came to this school. I remember seeing a magazine cover.\"",
    162: "And you were on it!",
    163: "So I was right.",
    164: "Than what you told me in the main hall when this all began.",
    165: "That can't be your only reason, can it?",
    166: "How can you talk like that?",
    167: "You sacrificed your own sister! How does that not even bother you?",
    168: "Damn straight, that's exactly what we're going to do. We're going to solve all these mysteries.",
    169: "And then, we'll have our victory!",
    170: "You're talking about the motives you provided to try and get us to kill each other, right?",
    171: "The driving force behind the motive you presented us with at that point was human connections.",
    172: "It was... our past, right?",
    173: "It was money, wasn't it? Greed.",
    174: "What's the point of all this? Why are you making us go through this case by case?",
    175: "In her case, it was betrayal.",
    176: "You mean, the world beyond the school walls?",
    177: "Actually, she might remember.",
    178: "The other Toko. Genocide Jack.",
    179: "The two of them share certain kinds of knowledge, but their memories aren't linked, right?",
    180: "So you didn't lose your memory after all.",
    181: "But I didn't say anything yet.",
    182: "H-hold on! That doesn't make any sense!",
    183: "There's no way that happened a year ago!",
    184: "I mean, we only came to this school a few weeks ago!",
    185: "If some kind of world-ending event happened a year ago,",
    186: "Then how do you explain the totally normal world we were living in up till then?",
    187: "If we accept that what you say is true.",
    188: "Then we've all lost our memories of the last two years after coming to this school.",
    189: "Hiro, there's something I'd like you to take a look at.",
    190: "This notebook right here.",
    191: "I found it in the locker room on the second floor.",
    192: "If you don't mind, could you take a look inside?",
    193: "It looks like you actually did attend class here at Hope's Peak.",
    194: "But somehow, he forgot all about it.",
    195: "\"Figure out... what?\"",
    196: "The moment I lost my memories, I can't think of any time other than that day.",
    197: "When I first came to the gates of this school and stepped foot in the main hall,",
    198: "When I passed out, I was overcome with a strange sensation.",
    199: "After I passed out, I woke up in a classroom, with my head on a desk.",
    200: "I assumed not much time had passed since I'd collapsed in the main hall.",
    201: "You're the one who set things up to be like this!",
    202: "What?",
    203: "It could only have been the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy.",
    204: "He wanted to turn the school into a shelter to try and protect us.",
    205: "To protect us from the despair and tragedy taking place outside.",
    206: "That's why he asked us to make that promise.",
    207: "to say that we were willing to live in this school forever.",
    208: "And because we had that same hope?",
    209: "That's why we all agreed to live here forever.",
    210: "Why? Why would you do that?",
    211: "What are you saying?",
    212: "You're talking about you hijacking the airwaves, aren't you?",
    213: "\"So you just used us? To bring despair to everyone in the outside world?\"",
    214: "Give and take? You're so full of SHIT!",
    215: "Wait, hold on! You've just been going on about whatever you feel like, but-",
    216: "But there's no real reason for us to believe anything you have to say!",
    217: "You say the world's fallen apart, but I haven't seen it for myself.",
    218: "So I don't acknowledge it. I don't accept it as the truth.",
    219: "Well, even if it's all true...",
    220: "I refuse to give in. I refuse to lose to you.",
    221: "FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYONE YOU'VE KILLED!",
    222: "No! This isn't just some game to us!",
    223: "It's murder, plain and simple!",
    224: "You stole our memories, invented reasons for us to do it. You pushed us all into a corner!",
    225: "IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!",
    226: "What do you mean?",
    227: "What?",
    228: "It's okay. Nobody would actually vote to kill themselves, right?",
    229: "What are you saying? So no matter what, we're doomed!",
    230: "M-me?",
    231: "No! That's not it!",
    232: "G-Guys?",
    233: "Kyoko!",
    234: "No one, nobody's gonna give in to despair!",
    235: "WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE TO YOU!",
    236: "We won't give up!",
    237: "As long as there's hope, we'll never give up.",
    238: "I refuse to give up! I refuse to get bored! I refuse to throw it all away!",
    239: "I REFUSE TO DESPAIR!",
    240: "Because all I have going for me is the desire to keep moving forward.",
    241: "What the...?",
    242: "Thank you.",
    243: "Thank you.",
    244: "Thank you.",
    245: "Thank you.",
