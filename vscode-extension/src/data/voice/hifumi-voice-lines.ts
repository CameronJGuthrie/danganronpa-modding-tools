    2: "Wow, this is starting to sound like a real trial.",
    3: "Mm-hmm, yes. Then it's been decided.",
    4: "We've reached the end.",
    5: "Sure, but can you or anyone else prove that?",
    6: "So, that's how you would twist the argument and send us all off in the wrong direction?",
    7: "Mm-hmm. You possess a most terrifying talent.",
    8: "Ha ha ha! Yes, very true, very true!",
    9: "What? Are you saying the culprit didn't even know where he was? That's inconceivable!",
    10: "SAY WHAAAAAT?",
    11: "I'm sorry, but I give up! Quit without saving!",
    12: "Fine. How about this? The killer got in the easy way.",
    13: "They could have knocked and said they wanted to talk or something, and Miss Mizono just let him in.",
    14: "Oh-ho! Trying to argue against me? Sounds like someone doesn't know his place.",
    15: "Hello? Why exactly can't that be it?",
    16: "If you got an invitation like that from the ultimate pop sensation, what young man could resist?",
    17: "Of course, I'm only into 2D, so it wouldn't have any effect on me.",
    18: "I see, I see. And so the truth draws ever closer.",
    19: "And that's what broke Ms. Mizono's wrist!",
    20: "Okay, so how did the sheath get damaged?",
    21: "Which means whoever had the kitchen knife was the one who attacked first.",
    22: "Oh, my.",
    23: "Hmm? I'm not sure whether to take that as an insult or a compliment.",
    24: "Then the one who attacked first was...",
    25: "But doesn't that plan seem a little risky?",
    26: "For one thing, even if her plan worked, Mr. Naegi would just tell everyone they'd switched rooms.",
    27: "Wait, then you're saying she had this all planned out?",
    28: "Oh, yeah, it looks like...",
    29: "No, it's just, look at the numbers assuming they're not numbers.",
    30: "Don't these first two, one-one, look less like two numbers and more like one letter?",
    31: "Our little grey cells are really getting excited now!",
    32: "*laughs* Interesting.",
    33: "*Glare*",
    34: "Okay, so the person who would have had the trash room key was...",
    35: "Huh? Me?",
    36: "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!",
    37: "Someone threw that... threw a gap in the gate?",
    38: "Then that must be what he used! There aren't any other tools anywhere!",

    2: "Hey, so, speaking of Genocide Jack...",
    3: "I don't know who that is!",
    4: "Oh, that's right. Boob lust.",
    5: "YOU LIE!!!",
    6: "Oh, okay. But still, to go and say that about Miss Fukawa is...",
    7: "Y-y-y-what the heck?!",
    8: "Um, Miss Jack, uh, Jill, can I ask you a question?",
    9: "Some of us think you might be the mastermind behind our entire situation. What are your thoughts on that?",
    10: "Ah, yes. That is remarkably different from the other murders.",
    11: "Maybe you used the dumbbell 'cause you couldn't find any scissors in the school?",
    12: "Ngh! She's fully equipped!",
    13: "Are you saying Mr. Togami did it?",
    14: "Nothing strange about that, I'd say.",
    15: "If you're presented with the opportunity to check out the girls' locker room, you absolutely take it!",
    16: "That's a natural reaction for any guy!",
    17: "I wish you'd taken me with you.",
    18: "Then there must be something very fishy indeed about that rope.",
    19: "What? An extension cord?",
    20: "Protein coffee?",
    21: "Huh? What thing?",
    22: "Maybe Mr. Naegi's initial assumption is just... wrong?",
    23: "Examine her carefully? Like, using our hands?",
    24: "No way, no way, no way, no way, no way!",
    25: "Ah, I see. So, she was actually a he. Interesting. Thank you for confirming this fact.",
    26: "WHAAAAAT?!",
    27: "Ah, he's off in his own little world.",
    28: "What? But aren't you the one who accused him in the first place?",
    29: "Nyaaah! No! Not game over!",
    30: "Huh? Really?",
    31: "So, Mr. Fujisaki was on his way to meet with someone, and then they were going to work out together?",
    32: "What? You wanna track down some fingerprints or something?",
    33: "I... I don't even have a tracksuit.",
    34: "Because exercising sucks.",
    35: "Y-you noticed such a tiny detail?",
    36: "My time has nearly come.",
    37: "That's what my little ghost friend is telling me.",
    38: "Actually, you know, now that I'm thinking about it here calmly, it might not be all that relevant.",
    39: '"If you really insist, then..."',
    40: "Um, here it is.",
    41: "It happens to be an e-handbook. I found it laying on the ground, so I scooped it up.",
    42: "For a fact indeed.",
    43: "I was totally sure I'd found it.",
    44: "Well, that's what I was hoping. But it's busted. It won't even turn on.",
    45: "I flippin' knew it!",
    46: "Yeah, cause I found the handbook laying on the floor of the sauna.",
    47: "That is a mere trifling speck of knowledge.",
    48: "Indeed, quite the mystery.",
    49: "Whoa! Seriously?",
    50: "Thank you.",
    51: "Thank you.",

    104: "I'm sorry I'm putting you through all this.",
    105: "But I promise that as long as you're in this school, I will do everything I can to protect you.",
    106: "As the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy, that's the very least I can do for you.",
